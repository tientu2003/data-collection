Now, a great many factors influence the choice of building ma​terials. You can’t make a house of cards, right? And “people who live in glass houses…” and all that… Anyhow, today I’d like to say a few words about flooring.", "Some artificial materials can be used, like", "", "for instance, which offer mixed blessings when used as a flooring surface. On the one hand, plastic is cheaper than nearly any other alternative, short of bare ground. Plastic also does not warp like wood. On the other hand, the best that can be said about plastic is that it “looks like” wood or stone. However, it cannot replace the real materials. As I have men​tioned, I’m fixing up a new house. The decorator my wife hired told me, “Plastic does a great job of looking exactly like plastic.” Besides, it scratches easily, fades or discolours, and starts cracking within a year or two. So, if you’re fitting out a sleazy hotel or plan to live in a trailer park, go with the plastic. Really, though, for all intents and purposes, this leaves us with wood or stone as choices for flooring.", "Stone and wood are alike in at least one respect: both go through", "", "before they can be put to use. Since few of us cut our own lumber or quarry our own stone, this is not perhaps a pressing con​cern. Still, do-it-yourselfers would do well to remember to buy only properly", "", "wood. Unseasoned wood warps and a warped floor quickly becomes firewood (and its owner quickly becomes poorer). Likewise, except for dull-hued materials like slate or sandstone, most stone floors are", "", "before installation. The choice goes well be​yond just wood or stone – each type requires many further consider​ations. A few special remarks are called for when considering wood, for example. As always, aesthetics, personal taste, and layout all play roles as well as the type of house or room. Oh, and certainly don’t forget", "", ". When it comes to cost, a rule of thumb is that the softer and less exotic the wood, the lower the cost. In the US, for instance, pine is both ubiquitous and cheap. Mahogany is imported and exorbitantly expensive. If you’re on any kind of budget when remodeling, it’s really helpful to remember to go for the softer woods.", "Aside from cost, there are still lots of different factors that are im​portant in choosing the best flooring for the job. Continuing with the example of wood, one must consider the effects of each type of wood on the mood of the room. When selecting the best wood to use, particular attention needs to be paid to its", "", ", texture, and colour. In rooms where relaxation or deep thought is the aim – say bedrooms or the study – dark, strong grained woods are the rule.", "Here the grain ought to match the furniture for a feeling of homo​geneity. In rooms where activity and motion are typical – the dining room or living room – lighter, finer-grained lumber is more suitable.", "In such a setting, the wood grain might be useful in offering a contrast to the furniture. This leads to a feel of subconscious excitement, in keeping with the room’s function.", "In either case, though, consult a decorator. It is a decorator’s job to know what materials to use to fit the function of the room. Though some things about putting together a room are subjective and based on one’s individual taste, materials appropriate to a room’s function are much more straightforward. A decorator takes the needs of the customer and uses a mathematical formula, rather than subjective", "", ". Since feelings vary from person to person, verbal descriptions of wood types tend to be ambiguous. You want the wood you select, not something approximate! And if you do decide to do it yourself, remember that all wood must be treated with preservatives to en​hance its appearance and preserve its natural beauty.", "In the case of stone, or “quarry tile” as flat-cut flooring stone is prop​erly called, a new set of considerations must be weighed up. Simple colour aside, the degree of reflection must be kept in mind. This is called the “reflectance rate”, which is expressed in a number between 0.0 and 1.0, depending on the amount of light it reflects.", "At one end of the scale is polished silver. At a rating of 1.0, this shiny surface reflects nearly all of the light directed at it. Numbers closer to zero describe materials that absorb more light. Moving down the scale a bit, we see the plastic that has been painted white has a rate of", "", ", which makes sense. We know that the colour white reflects all other colours while black absorbs all colours, and plastic itself is a relatively reflective material.", "Materials that are denser and darker have reflectance rates much closer to zero. The quarry tile I mentioned a while ago has a rate of", "", ". As you may know, quarry tile is generally dark brown and made from clay so it is quite dense. Of course, there is considerable vari​ation among types of quarry tile because of the hue or treatment of the clay during its creation.", "Does anyone have any guesses as to what materials may have a rate of almost 0.0? We can guess most of these materials are black in colour, but plastic, wood, and even stone reflect some light. One material with a rate of almost 0.0 is", "", ". The texture produces almost no shine at all.", "Carrara marble, despite its white hue, is actually lower in reflectivity than black onyx! In any case, the fact that tiles vary somewhat should not be forgotten. A highly reflective floor would not be suitable in a library; it would be indispensable in a ballroom (should your home be large enough to feature one). Again, a rule of thumb is that “light means lively”. Since form and material follow function, one should only use the more reflective materials in rooms where the cultivation and expression of energy is important. Bear in mind too that most types of stone cost more than all but the rarest of woods.", "Of course, there is no reason why some rooms of a house should not feature wood floors or other stone tiles. You can even mix the two. A room with wood panels on the walls can have a beautiful stone floor. My bedroom has white birch walls and a light blue slate floor. The place looks like a Russian hunting lodge. Remember, though, go with what feels right for you. Good taste and the “laws” of interior design are the homeowner’s servants, not his master.

Early symbols were based on pictographs and ideograms before they were developed into logographic writing systems. These systems are still in use in some non-literate cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. Indeed, elements of pictography are still found in modern Chinese characters, and it is often an interesting exercise to trace the origins of some Chinese characters.

The stone, now known as the Rosetta Stone, was studied in significant depth by scholars, and was first deciphered by Frenchman Jean-François Champollion in 1822.

We found that this huge footfall was too demanding for the facilities that we were able to provide, and so we decided to expand ourselves in order to give every visitor a brilliant and exciting experience.

Unfortunately some visitors had started feeding the animals during these late night viewing times, which disrupted their feeding pattern and as a result we had to ban food in the viewing areas.", "One of our most exciting additions to the zoo is our native kangaroo, who we have named Frisbee.

Roberts’ cameras are presently used as nanny-cams, which allow parents to watch their nannies to ensure that they are responsibly attending to the children that they have been employed to care for.

Today we will be looking into the practice of company outsourcing, using TCP Technologies as a case study. Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar with this practice, I will give you a summative definition: company outsourcing involves the contracting of various business activities by one company to another. This practice will sometimes occur from a western company to a party based in a third world country, the rationale being to make significant financial savings on lower international labour rates and to potentially increase quality.", "Now, our case study for today is TCP Technologies – a party located in India that receives outsourced tasks from western companies. The manager of TCP Technologies is a man called Manjeet Khanna who has personally developed a series of aims and philosophies by which the company is expected to operate. He claims that the most important of these philosophies is to create a workplace where each individual member has the opportunity to contribute their opinion to the operations of the company. That is to say that he found it important to develop a", "", "environment.", "As a means of ensuring quality from every individual at TCP Technologies, a grading system has been developed that encourages an ethos of hard work and recognises accomplishment.

So, Alison, tell us something about cocoa beans.", "Alison: Cocoa beans, also called cacao beans, are the primary constituent in making chocolate. Grown in tropical areas in South and Central America, West Africa and Asia, the cocoa tree is often raised on small, family-owned farms. When the harvested pods are opened to expose the beans, the pulp and cocoa seeds are removed and the rind is discarded. The pulp and seeds are then piled in heaps, placed in bins, or laid out on grates for several days. During this time, the seeds and pulp undergo a process called ‘sweating’, where the thick pulp liquefies as it ferments. The fermented pulp trickles away, leaving cocoa seeds behind to be collected.", "", "and then the bags holding them are ready to be transported.", "But the most important step in processing the cocoa bean is cleaning it. Once the beans are unloaded from the railroad cars,", "", "and then weighed by machines. Then the pods are split, and the seeds or beans are covered with a sweet white pulp or mucilage. On arrival at the factory,", "", ". The wet beans are then transported to a facility so they can be fermented and dried. They are fermented for 4 to 7 days and must be mixed every 2 days. They are dried for 5 to 14 days, depending on the climate conditions. The fermented beans are dried by spreading them out over a large surface and constantly raking them.", "Then the beans are ready to be roasted. Now, roasting takes place at a high temperature and then the beans are boiled in a heated chamber.", "", ". But prior to this, the beans are trodden and shuffled about using bare human feet. During this process, red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer colour, polish, and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Now, back to what I was saying. After the beans are cracked,", "", ".", ".", "Host:  Wow, that is not a simple process, is it? But someone told me that different roasting levels of coffee can lead to different kind of flavours.", "Alison: Yes. Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavour of coffee by causing the green coffee beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting. The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale, but small-scale commercial roasting has grown significantly with the trend toward ‘single-origin’ coffees served at specialty shops. Some coffee drinkers even roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with the flavour profile of the beans and ensure the freshest possible roast. So here, I am going to introduce some of these roasted coffee beans and their special flavours.", "Now, the First Crack is lighter-bodied, and has a higher acidity level with no obvious roast flavour,", "", ". This level of roast is ideal for tasting the full original character of the coffee. The Green Beans are raw, unroasted coffee beans.", "", ". We’ve also got French Roast. And the flavour that comes across in French roast coffee usually has more to do with the roasting process than the actual quality of the beans.

Their population has drastically declined. Approximately 120,000 African penguins remain in the wild, and their population has decreased by 90% in the past 60 years. They are considered to be vulnerable and have been listed as being endangered. Two major factors have contributed to their decline.", ".", "With the limited number of breeding pairs, survivorship becomes difficult for African penguins.

To do that, you need to store it somehow, and that has to be essentially forever.", "It is perhaps for this reason that main believe that, rather than storing the carbon dioxide as a gas, it is better to react it with metal oxides, such as magnesium or calcium, which results in the formation of a hard carbonate material.

This carries, however, three serious disadvantages, namely: the risk of leaks, the considerable costs involved, and finally, the unproven", ".

Although the gas would be deep and sealed over by masses of rock and earth, the huge pressures in these spaces would turn the gas into", "stale, capable of moving through rock fissures or faults.

In today’s lecture, I’m going to talk about the role of sleep in humans and animals. Of all the biological processes in the animal kingdom, sleep is perhaps the most important.

Without sleep, an animal is much less capable of avoiding an", "– this is the case for all animals, whether they are reptiles,", "or fish.

For example, the dolphin must float to the surface as it sleeps in order to", ". Like other large sea mammals, they keep one eye open and one half of the brain awake at all times to maintain some amount of consciousness required to breathe and to watch out for possible threats. They sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep.", "Birds also have unusual sleeping patterns, mostly due to being constantly", "in the presence of numerous predators. They usually sleep quite lightly -for example, Swainson’s Thrush, also called Olive-backed Thrush, is a medium-sized thrush that takes hundreds of naps during the day, each of which lasts just a few seconds. While migrating, migratory birds tend to function well on micronaps.", "Horses, on the other hand, do most of their sleeping standing up. Scientists think that horses develop their habit of sleeping upright as a defense mechanism, a way of protecting themselves against predators, and a standing position keeps a horse in a constant state of readiness to race away if danger should approach.", "Also, horses do occasionally take short naps lying down. Horses are heavy animals with big muscles, but their", "are surprisingly delicate, so lying in one position for a long time could well injure a horse. Just like humans, animals can also have", ". Dr. John Hedricks and Adrian Morrison from the School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, determined that certain diseases were primarily associated with the sleep states in animals. In their research they emphasised that because so much in this area still remains unclear, animal models were very important for studies of sleep disorders. The physiology of sleep in animals is similar to that of humans.", "But why do we humans sleep? Researchers and scientists believe it helps us organise our", "of the day – that sleep acts as a kind of filing system for the brain.

Because of the similar sleeping pattern to that of humans,", "are often studied in order to increase our knowledge of human physiology. In one study, rats were kept awake for almost two weeks, and their behavior was observed. Researchers found the sleep-deprived rats could hardly remember anything of what they had been taught that day. For example, one rat had been taught to recognise pictures of various Parisian landmarks in order to receive food – pressing a button below a picture of the Louvre would result in food being released and so forth. However, when deprived of sleep, they would press buttons seemingly at random.", "In addition to rats, the fruit fly, a small insect that feeds and breeds on spoiled fruit, also has been used as a model organism and thousands of scientists around the world work on it. But why was the fruit fly chosen to be studied? It was for practical reasons. The most important one is that the relationship between fly and human genes is so close that the sequences of newly discovered human genes, including genes that show a susceptibility, can often be matched against their fly counterparts. This provides an indication of the function of the human gene and could help in the development of effective drugs to help people with sleeping disorders. Therefore, many scientists today choose to study the", "of the fruit fly, which could make a particularly important contribution to the understanding of developmental processes in humans.", "In conclusion, sleep is a necessary part of life not just for humans, but for the entire animal kingdom.

The detector there consists of a spherical container filled with", ".

Thus, as exploration continues, new caves will be discovered, and it is likely that the numbers could radically change in the future.", "With caves being such mysterious and intriguing places, the obvious question concerns how they form. The most common cause is the effect of slightly acidic water in a process called ‘dissolution’. Here, water seeps into the ground, and down through rock masses.

These caves are usually the shortest, about 50 meters at most, since the erosive action of the waves can only reach a certain distance.", "However, it is limestone eaves which will always be the most interesting.

There’s never been a better time for people who like to do their own interior house painting. Although people still lead very busy lives,thanks to the availability of various new DIY materials, you can now decorate your home in a more efficient and a more environmentally-friendly way.", "In two thousand and nine alone,approximately fifty-three million litres of the paint that was sold in the UK were left untouched- that’s enough to fill twenty one Olympic-sized swimming pools.", "It's easy to overestimate how much paint you’ll need to decorate your room if you use guesswork. And if you know exactly how much paint is needed, you avoid unnecessary waste.There are automatic paint calculators available now - most of the major paint manufacturers provide them - look on their websites, or just google ‘paint calculator’ and see what comes up. Then simply measure the circumference and height of the room in metres, enter this into the calculator along with the type of surface you're painting, and it will tell you how many litres of paint you’ll need.", "But if you do end up with leftover paint, you can donate it to an organisation like Community RePaint.They will take the paint from you and redistribute it to local charities and voluntary organisations, so it goes to a good home. You can find more information about Community RePaint on communityrepaint - all one word - dot org dot uk.", "Speaker: Another way of avoiding paint wastage is to check you're completely happy with your colourchoice before starting to paint. For example,you can get a small sample of the colour you’re thinking of using, then paint a board and move it around the room, so you can see how it looks against your furnishings, and in different lights. Also, it’s always better to buy high quality paints, because you get what you pay for. If you buy cheap paint you might need to apply two or three coats to achieve the same coverage that you’d get from one coat of a good-quality paint. You could also spend a week on a job that could have been done in a day or two. And consider the environment.Most paint manufacturers now sell water-based paints that don’t contain harmful chemicals or give off harmful odours, so get one of these. You can also buy paint that’s packaged in recyclable containers. There’s a lot more choice than there used to be.", "You can only do a good job, which will last, if you prepare the surfaces thoroughly before painting. In fact, in many ways if you want to do a professional-looking job, this is more important than the painting itself. If there are any cracks or patches of loose plaster, painting over them won’t solve the problem.Take the plaster out and fill the holes, allowing enough time for the new plaster to dry. And you won’t get a smooth finish if the walls are dusty or greasy, so washing with water isn’t enough.Use a solution of decorator’s soapand rinse well with warm water afterwards.", "When you're ready to paint, we suggest you use a medium-pile roller for walls and ceilings. A lot of people tend to use short-pile rollers, but these give a patchy finish, and that wastes paint and time. Similarly, long-pile rollers can create a thick, textured effect, which looks messy. The same goes for brushes. The stronger the bristles, the easier they are to wash and reuse. And as you’ve chosen a water-based paint,clean your brushes with cold water, because it’s more energy-efficient that way. As you're decorating, keep transferring small amounts of paint into a tray and keep topping it up when you need to. This reduces the chance of it being contaminated by dust and pieces of dirt ... And finally, water-based paint doesn’t have a lingering smell, so that's not an issue any more, but it’s air flow rather than heat that helps the paint dry quicker, so to help finish the job in the quickest timeleave your doors and windows open. The faster the paint is dry and the job finished, the quicker you can start enjoying your room!", "In tomorrow’s programme I’ll be giving some advice ..."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Choose the correct letter A, B, C"], "context_table": [], "type": "choice", "questions": [{"question_number": "11", "question_text": "According to the speaker, why is it a good time for D-l-Y painting?", "answer_options": ["A.

Was it hard work?", "Yes, it was. I’d had full-time work before - I’ve done various unskilled jobs during university holidays, and some of those involved long hours - so I thought I’d find it easy. I was wrong though. I thinkwhen you’re on placement you’re always trying to prove yourself ...", "So you push yourself hard to succeed?", "Yes. But I got a lot of support from my employers. They were always helpful. And then at the end of the placement I was given formal feedback.", "Do you mean on your engineering ability?", "Well, no, I didn’t really need that because we had team meetings every other day, and so I had the chance to discuss technical issues and ask about anything that wasn’t clear. The evaluation was about general workplace things, likeorganisational ability, initiative ... That sort of thing ...", "I get the impression you think you benefited from the placement ... ?", "Well the best thing is thatthey’ve offered me a jobfor next year! Depending on my exam results of course, but still ...", "A permanent one?", "Yes! But apart from that I learned so much . The industrial environment was much more demanding than the academic one, so my general skills improved. Like time Management ... meeting deadlines ...

Some of them have a clear provenance, that is, we know exactly where and when they were written, but the origin of many manuscripts has been a complete mystery, that is, until two thousand and nine when geneticists started using DNA testing to shed light on their origins.", "But before looking at the new research, I need to explain something about the way the manuscripts were produced - particularly what they were written on. Virtually all were written on treated animal skins and there were essentially two types. The first was parchment, which is made of sheep skin. It has the quality of being very white but also beingthin. It has a naturally greasy surface which meant it was hard to erase writing from it. This made it much sought after forcourt documentsin medieval times.", "The second type is vellum, which is calf skin. This was most often used for any very ‘high- status’ documents because it provided the best writing surface so scribes could achieve lettering ofhigh quality.", "So, once the animal hides had been chosen, they had to be prepared. Where the right materials were on hand, the skins were put into large barrels or vats of lime, where they were agitated or stirred frequently. But if lime wasn’t available, then the hides wereburied. Both these techniques were designed to cause the hair to slough off, and the skins to become gelatinous and therefore more flexible.", "The next stage was to put the hides on stretcher frames and pull them very tight. While on the frame they were scraped with a moon-shaped knife in order to create a uniformthickness. For parchment, that was the end of the process, but for vellum there was an additional stage where it wasbleached, in order to achieve the desired colour.", "Historian: So, what does all this preparation mean for the quest to identify the origins of ‘mystery’manuscripts? Well, until recently the only way historians and other academics were able to guess at origins was either through the analysis of the handwriting style, or from thedialectin which the piece was written. But these techniques have proven unreliable, for a number of reasons.", "It was thus decided to try to look at the problem from a different angle ... to start from what is known, that is, the small number of manuscripts whose origins we do already know. Because these parchments and vellum are both made from animal hides, it was possible to subject them to DNA testing and to identify the genetic markers for the date and location of production. From this was created what is known as a ‘baseline’. The next stage was to test the mystery manuscripts, finding their DNA characteristics and then making comparisons between the known and the mystery scripts. Genetic similarities and differences enabled the", "scientists to gain more information about the origins of the many manuscripts we had known virtually nothing about up to that point.", "Now you might ask - what are the potential uses of this new information? Well, obviously, it can shed light on the origin of individual books and manuscripts. But that’s not all. It can also shed light on theevolutionof the whole of the manuscripts production industry in medieval times.

I asked the first four to do a set writing task and as they wrote, to talk into a tape-recorder ... a technique known as ‘think aloud’ ... this was in order to getexperimentaldata. Whilst they were doing this, a research assistant recorded them usingvideo- I thought it might be helpful for me in my transcriptions later on. I then asked four experienced writers to do exactly the same task. After this, I made a comparison between the two sets of data and this helped me to produce aframeworkfor analysis. In particular, I identified five major stages which all creative writers seem to go through when generating this genre of text. I think it was fairly effective but still needs some work ... so I intend to tighten this up later for use with subsequent data sets.", "I then wanted to see whether experienced writers were actually producing the better pieces of writing. So I asked aneditor, an expert in reviewing creative writing, to decide which were the best pieces of writing. This person put the eight pieces of work in order of quality - in rank order - and, using his evaluations, I was then able to work out whichsequenceof the five stages seemed to lead to the best quality writing.", "Now my findings are by no means conclusive as this point ...

Now the steam pit is ideal in certain conditions because the heat is below ground level, for example, if there’s a strong wind and you’re afraid a fire might spread. But when it’s safe to have an open fire you can use the bamboo oven method. You get a length of bamboo, which as you probably know is hollow, and consists of a number of individual sections with a wall in-between. You use a sharp stick to make a hole in each of the dividing walls apart from the end one. Then you lean the bamboo over a fire, with the top propped up by a forked stick and the bottom sitting on the ground. You pour enough water in the top to fill the bottom section, and thenlight a fire underneath that section to heat the water.

It once flourished in Britain and throughout the world’s temperate zones, but over the last few decades has declined considerably. Before I go on to explain the steps being taken to save it in England, let me start by looking at some background information and why the juniper has been so important in cultural as well as ecological terms, historically and in the present day.", "Firstly, I want to emphasise the fact that juniper is a very ancient plant. It has been discovered that it was actually amongst the first species of plants to establish itself in Britain in the period following the most recentIce Age. And, as I say, it has a much valued place in British culture. It was used widely as a fuel during the Middle Ages because, when burnt, the smoke given off is all butinvisibleand so any illicit activities involving fire could go on without being detected, for example, cooking game hunted illegally. It also has valuable medicinal properties. Particularly during large epidemics, oils were extracted from the juniper wood and sprayed in the air to try to prevent the spread ofinfectionin hospital wards. And these days, perhaps its most well known use is in cuisine...cooking, where its berries are a much-valued ingredient, used toflavoura variety of meat dishes and also drinks.", "Turning now to ecological issues, juniper bushes play an important role in supporting other living things. If juniper bushes are wiped out, this would radically affect many different insect and alsofungus species. We simply cannot afford to let this species die out.", "So, why is the juniper plant declining at such a rapid rate? Well a survey conducted in the north and west of Britain in two thousand and four to five showed that a major problem is the fact that in present-day populations, ratios between thesexesare unbalanced and without a proper mix of male and female, bushes don’t get pollinated. Also, the survey found that in a lot of these populations, the plants are the same age, so this means that bushes grow old and start to die at similar times leading toswift extinctionof whole populations.", "Now, the charity Plantlife is trying to do something to halt the decline in juniper species. It’s currently trying out two new major salvage techniques, this time focusing onlowlandregions of England. The first thing it’s trying is to providesheltersfor the seedlings in areas where juniper populations are fairly well established. These, of course, are designed to help protect the plants at their most vulnerable stage. A further measure is that in areas where colonies have all but died out, numbers are being bolstered by the planting ofcuttingswhich have been taken from healthy bushes elsewhere.", "Now, I hope I’ve given a clear picture of the problems facing this culturally and ecologically valuable plant and of the measures being taken by Plantlife to tackle them.

My name is Tony Walters and I'm your guide for today. Could I please see your tickets for the guided tour?", "I'd also like to remind you that any tickets bought today do not include a visit to the reading rooms. I’m afraid we don’t do visits on Fridays - or any weekday during working hours, so as not to disturb the readers. But if you do want to see those rooms, the only day there are tours is onSundays. So, I don't want anyone to be disappointed about that today. OK? thank you.Right. We'll start with a brief introduction As many ol you know, this is the United Kingdom's National Library and you can see that this is a magnificent modern building. It was first designed by Sir Colin St John Wilson in 1977, and inaugurated by Her Majesty the Queen more than twenty years later, in1998.", "As you can see. the size is immense and the basements alone have 300 kilometres of shelving - and that's enough to hold about 12 million books. The total floor space here is100,000square metres and, as I'll show you, the library houses a huge range of facilities and exhibition spaces, and it has a thousand staff members based here in the building - so, you can appreciate the scale of our operation.", "In fact, this was the biggest publicly-funded building constructed in the United Kingdom last century. It is still funded by thegovernmentas a national institution, ot course, and it houses one of the most important collections in the world. The different items come from every continent and span almost 3000 years.", "The library isn't a public library, though you can't just come in and join and borrow any of the books. Access to the collections is limited to those involved in carrying outresearch, so it's really a huge reference library for that purpose, and anyone who wants to consult any materials that are kept here can formally apply to use the library reading rooms.", "Right, well, here we are, standing at the Meeting Point on the lower ground floor just to the right of the Main Entrance. I've given you all a plan of the building so that we can orientate ourselves and get an idea of where we'll be going. Now outside the Main Entrance you'll see the wide Piazza with the stunning sculpture of Newton.", "The sculptor was Paolozzi, but it's based on the famous image by William Blake - and it’s definitely worth a closer look. On the other side ot the Piazza from the statue is theConference Centre, which is used for all kinds of international conventions we'll take a quick look inside at the end of our tour.", "Looking ahead of us now, you'll see that we'restanding opposite the staircase down to the basement where you'll find the cloakroom, and to the left of that, we have theinformation deskwhere you can find out about any current exhibitions, the times of the tours and anything you need to know - if you don't have a tour guide. As you can see, on this lower ground floor we also have abookshopthat's the area over to the left of the main entrance. You'll be free to browse there when we get back to the ground floor.", "Now, opposite the main entrance on this floor we have the open stairs leading up to the upper ground floor. And at the top of them, in the middle of the upper ground floor, you can see a kind of glass-sided tower that rises all the way up through the ceiling and up to the first floor. This is called theKing's Library, it's really the heart of the building, it was built to house the collection that was presented to the nation in 1823 by the King. You can see it from every floor above ground. When we go up there, you'll find the library's Treasures Gallery on the left. Can you find it on your plan? That's the exciting one, so we'll be visiting that first but we'll also take a look at thestamp displaysituated behind it, on the way to the cafe - a lot of people miss that. The Cafeteria runs along the back of the floor and, in the right hand corner, you’ll find the lifts andtoilets ... ha, always good to locate them. The othermain area on that floor is the Public Access Catalogue section and I’ll show you how that operates when we get up there ..."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the sentences below.", "Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer."], "context_table": [["The British Library"]], "type": "table", "questions": []}, {"context": ["Label the plan below.", "Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer.", "​"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "16", "question_text": "(16) ________", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "Conference Centre/Center"}, {"question_number": "17", "question_text": "(17) ________", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "information desk"}, {"question_number": "18", "question_text": "(18) ________", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "bookshop"}, {"question_number": "19", "question_text": "(19) ________", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "King(')s Library"}, {"question_number": "20", "question_text": "(20) ________", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "stamp display"}]}]}, {"audio_url": "https://s4-media1.study4.com/media/plus_media/audio/2_Practice-20Test-202_sec3.mp3", "transcript": ["Good afternoon, Dave, come on in and take a seat.", "Hi, Dr Green thanks", "Hang on a minute, I'll just find the first draft ot your project paper and we can have a look at it together. Now yours is the one on Work Placement, isn't it?", "Yeah, that's right.", "So what made you choose that for your project?", "Well, l suppose it was because sending students off to various companies for work experience seems to be such a typical part of educational courses these days - I mean, even school kids get to do it.But I felt everyone just kind of assumes it's a good thing and l guess I wanted to find out if that'sthe case.", "But you don't look at schools or colleges, right?You've stuck touniversity placement schemes", "Yeah, well, I quickly found that I had to limit my research, otherwise the area was just too big. Do you think that was OK?", "I think it's very sensible, especially as the objectives might be very different. So how many schemes did you look at?", "Well, Isent out about 150 questionnaires altogether - you know. 50 of each to university authorities, students and companies, and I got responses from15 educational institutions, and. er, 30 students in 11 individual companies.", "Great, that sounds like a good sample. And who did you send your company questionnaires to?", "Well, the idea was to have them done by thestudents’ Line Managers, but sometimes they were filled in by the Human Resources manager or even the owner of the company.", "Right. I didn’t find a full list anywhere, so I thinkit's very important to provide that, really. You can put it as an appendix at the back.", "Right. I've got a record of allthe respondentsso that'll be easy. I hope other things were OK. I mean I’ve already put such a lot of work into this project, identifying the companies and so on.", "Oh, I can tell I think you've done a good job overall.", "I thought your questionnaires were excellent, and you'd obviously done lots of backgroundreading, but there were a few problems with the introduction. First of all, I think you need to make some slight changes to theorganisationof your information there, at present it's a bit confused.", "OK. What did you have in mind?", "Well, you write quite a bit about Work Placement in general, but you never explain what you mean by the term.", "So you think I should give adefinition?", "Exactly. And the introduction is the place to do it. And then look, you start talking about what's been written on the topic - but it's all a bit mixed up with your own project.", "So do you think it would be better to have two sections there like, a survey of the literature as the introduction and then a separate section on theaimsof my research?", "I do. You can include your methods for collecting data in the second section too. It would be much dearer for your reader.. you know, establish the background first, then how your work relates to it, it would flow quite nicely then.", "Yes, I see what you mean", "Anyway, moving on i like the way you've grouped your findings into three maintopic areas", "Well, it became very obvious from the questionnaires that the preparation stage was really important for the whole scheme to work. So had to look at that first. And Ifound a huge variation between the different institutions, as you saw.", "I was wondering if you could give a summary at the end of this stage of what you consider to be the best practice you found, I think that would be very helpful ..", "Right, I'll just make a note of that What did you think of my second set of findings - onKey Skillsdevelopment? For me, this is the core of my whole project really ...", "And you've handled it very well. I wouldn't want you to make any changes you've already got a nice final focus on good practice there", "Thanks.", "Right, now I think the last part, which deals with the reasons why students don't learn ...", "What? The constraints on learning chapter?", "Yes. that's the one I think you need to refer to theevidencefrom your research a bit more closely here.

Now, in practical terms this might seem like a good thing - something we'd all like to be able to do. However, early research done with children in the USA in fact suggested that being bilingual interfered in some way withlearningand with the development of their mental processes, and so in those days bilingualism was regarded as something to be avoided, and parents were encouraged to bring their children up as monolingual - just speaking one language, But this research, which took place in the early part of the twentieth century is now regarded as unsound for various reasons, mainly because it didn't take into account other factors such as the children'ssocial and economicbackgrounds", "Now, in our last lecture we were looking at some of the research that's been done into the way children learn, into their cognitive development, and in fact we believe now that the relationship between bilingualism and cognitive development is actually apositiveone, it turns out that cognitive skills such as problem solving, which don't seem at first glance to have anything to do with how many languages you speak, are better among bilingual children than monolingual ones.", "And quite recently there's been some very interesting work done by Ellen Bialystok at York University' in Canada, she's been doing various studies on the effects of bilingualism and her findings provide some evidence that they might apply toadultsas well, they’re not just restricted to children.", "So how do you go about investigating something like this? Well, Dr Bialystok used groups of monolingual and bilingual subjects, aged from 30 right up to 88 for one experiment, she used a computer program which displayed either a red or a blue square on the screen. The coloured square could come up on either the left-hand or the right- hand side of the screen. If the square was blue, the subject had to press the left 'shift' key on the keyboard and if the square was red they had to press the right shift key. So they didn't have to react at all to the actual position of the square on the screen,just to the colour they saw. And she measured the subjects' reaction times by recording how long it took them to press the shift key. and how often they got it right.", "What she was particularly interested in was whether it took the subject longer to react when a square lit up on one side of the screen - say the left, and the subject had to press the shift key on the right band side. She'd expected that it would take more processing time than if a square lit up on the left and the candidates had topress a left key.", "This was because of a phenomenon known as the 'Simon effect', where, basically the brain gets a bit confused because of conflicting demands being made on it -in this case seeing something on the right, and having to react on the leftand this causes a person's reaction times to slow down.", "The results of the experiment showed thatthe bilingual subjects responded more quickly than the monolingual ones. That was true both when the squares were on the 'correct' side of the screen, so to speak, and - even more so - when they were not. So, bilingual people were better able to deal with the Simon effect than the monolingual ones.", "So, what's the explanation for this? Well, the result of the experiment suggests that bilingualpeople are better atignoring information which is irrelevant to the task inhand and just concentrating on what's important. One suggestion given by Dr Bialystok was that it might be because someone who speaks two languages can suppress the activity of parts of the brain when it isn't needed in particular, the part that processes whichever language isn’t being used at that particular time.", "Well, she Then went on to investigate that with a second experiment, but again the bilingual group performed better, and what was particularly interesting, and this isI think why the experiments have received so much publicity, is that in all cases, the performance gap between monolingual and bilinguals actually increased with age -which suggests that bilingualism protects the mind against decline, so insome way the life-long experience of managing two languages may prevent some of the negative effects of aging.

I already collected the handouts but I'm not very clear about all the details... I know we each have to choose an individual author ... I think I'm going to do Carlos Castenada ... I'm really interested in South American literature.", "Have you checked he's on the list that Dr Castle gave us? We can't just choose anyone.", " Yeah. I checked, it's OK Who did you choose?", " Well, l was thinking of choosing Ernest Hemingway, but then I thought no, I'll do a British author not an American one, so I chose Emily Bronte.", " OK .. and first of all it says we have to read a biography of our authorI guess it's OK if we just look up information about him on the Internet?", "No, it's got to be a full-length bookI think the minimum length's 250 pages . there's a list of biographies, didn't you get that?", " Oh right I didn't realise we had to stick with that. So what do we have to do when we've read the biography?", " Well, then we have to choose one work by the writer .. again it's got to be something quite long, we can't just read a short story.", "But I guess a collection of short stories would be OK?", "Yes, or even a collection of poems, they said, but I think most people are doing novels. I'm going to do Wuthenng Heights, I've read it before but I really want to read it again now I've found out more about the writer", " And then the video . .we have to make a short video about our author and about the book.

The video's meant to portray the essence of the writer's life and the piece of writing we choose.", " So when we read the biography, we have to think about what kind of person our writer is...", " Yes . and the historical context and so on. So for my writer, Emily Bronte, the biography gave a really strong impression of the place where she lived and the countryside around.", " Right, I'm beginning to get the idea.", " Er can I check the other requirements with you?", " Sure", " The handout said after we'd read the biography, we had to read the work we'd chosen by our author and choose a passage that's typical in some way that typifies the author'sinterests and style.", " Yes, but at the same time it has to relate tc the biographical extract you choose there's gottabe some sort of theme linking them", " OK. I'm with you", " And then you have to think about the video.", " So are we meant to dramatise the scene we choose?", " I guess we could, but there's not a lot of time for that ... I think it’s more how we can use things like sound effects tc create the atmosphere, the feeling we want.", " And presumablyvisualsas well?", " Yeah, of course - I mean, I suppose that's the whole point of making a video but whatever we use has to be historically in keeping with the author. We can use things like digital image processing to do it all", " So we can use any computer software we want?", " Sure. And it's important that we use arange- not just one software program That's actually one of the things we're assessed on.", " OK.", " Oh, and something else that’s apparently really important is to keep track of the materials we use and to acknowledge them", " Including stuff we download oft the Internet presumably?", " Yeah, so our video has to list all the material used with details of thesourcein a bibliography at the end.", " OK And you were talking about assessment of the protect did they give us the criteria? I couldn't find anything on the handout.", " Sure He gave us them in the lecture. Let’s see. you get 25 percent just for getting all the components done that’s both sets of reading, and the video. Then the second part is actually how successful we are at getting the essence of the work, they call that ’content’ and that counts for 50 percent Then the last 25 percent is on the video itself, the artistic and technical side.", " Great Well, that sounds a lot of work, but a whole lot better than just handing n a paper.

Nice to see you all again. As you know from the programme, today I want to talk to you about some research that is pushing back the frontiers of the whole field ol ecology. And this research is being carried out in the remoter regions of our planet .. places where the environment is harsh and until recently it was thought that the conditions couldn't sustain life of any kind. But, life forms are being found and these have been grouped into what is now known as extremophiles that is, organisms thatcan survive in the most extreme environments. And these discoveries may be setting a huge challenge for the scientists of the future, as you'll see in a minute.", "Now, the particular research I want to tell you aboutwas carried out in Antarctica one of the coldest and driest places on Earth. But a multinational team of researchers - from the US, Canada and New Zealand - recently discovered colonies of microbes in the soil there, where no one thought it was possible. Interestingly enough, some of the colonies were identified as a type of fungus called Beauvena Bassiana a fungus that lives on insects. But where are the insects in these utterly empty regions of Antarctica? The researchers concluded that this was clear evidence thatthese colonies were certainly not new arrivals they might've been there forcenturies, or even millennia possibly even since the last Ice Age'. Can you imagine their excitement?", "Now, some types of microbes had previously been found living just a few millimetres under the surface of rocks porous, Antarctic rocks, but this was the first time that living colonieshad been found surviving - ermrelatively deeply in the soil itself, several centimetres down in fact.", "So, the big question is: how can these colonies survive there? Well, we know that the organisms living very near the rock surface can still be warmed by the sun, so they can survive in their ownmicroclimate... and this keeps them from freezing during the day But this isn't the case for the colonies that are hidden under the soil.", "In their research paper, this team suggested that the very high amounts of salt in the soil might be the clue because this is what is preventing essential water from freezing.", "The team found that the saltconcentrationincreased the deeper down they went in the soil But while they had expected the number of organisms to be fewer down there, they actually found the opposite. In soil that had as much as 3000 parts of salt per million, relatively high numbers ol microbes were present - which seems incredible! But the point is that at those levels of salt, the temperature could drop to minus 56 degrees beforefrostwould cause any damage to the organisms", "This relationship between microbes and salt at temperatures way below the normal freezing point of water - is a really significant breakthrough As you all know, life is dependent on the availability of water inliquidform, and the role of salt al very low temperatures could be the key to survival in these kinds of conditions. Now the process at work here is calledsupercooling- and that's usually written as one word but it isn’t really understood as yet, so, there's a lot more for researchers to work on However, the fact that this process occurs naturally in Antarctica, may suggest that it might occur in other places with similar conditions, including on our neighbouring planet,Mars. So, you can start to see the wider implications of this kind of research.", "In short, it appears to support the growing belief that extraterrestrial life might be able to survive the dry, cold conditions on other planets alter all. Not only does this research produce evidence that life is possible there, it’s also informing scientists of thelocationswhere it might be found. So all of this might have great significance for future unmanned space missions.", "One specialist on Mars confirms the importance …"], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Choose the correct letter A, B, C"], "context_table": [], "type": "choice", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "’Extremophiles' are life forms that can live in", "answer_options": ["A. isolated areas.", "B. hostile conditions.", "C. new habitats."], "answer": "B"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "The researchers think that some of the organisms they found in Antarctica are", "answer_options": ["A. new species.", "B. ancient colonies.", "C. types of insects."], "answer": "B"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "The researchers were the first people to find life forms in Antarctica", "answer_options": ["A. in the soil.", "B. under the rock surface.", "C. on the rocks"], "answer": "A"}]}, {"context": ["Complete the sentences below.", "Write ONE WORD for each answer."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "34", "question_text": "Access to the sun's heat can create a (34) ________ for some organisms.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "microclimate"}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "The deeper the soil, the higher the (35) ________ of salt.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "concentration"}, {"question_number": "36", "question_text": "Salt can protect organisms against the effects of (36) ________ even at very low temperatures.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "frost"}, {"question_number": "37", "question_text": "All living things must have access to (37) ________ water.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "liquid"}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "Salt plays a part in the process of (38) ________ which prevents freezing.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "supercooling"}, {"question_number": "39", "question_text": "The environment of (39) ________ is similar to the dry valleys of Antarctica.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "Mars"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "This research may provide evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life forms and their possible (40) ________ on other planets.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "locations"}]}]}]},

Do you have a few minutes?", "W: Of course, Colin.", "\nM: For starters, what’s the schedule like?", "W: It’s a short trip. A little less than two full days. On Day 1, we’ll all meet at the public library and set off at 6am.", "\nM: How long a drive is it to the camp grounds?", "\nW: It’s one hour exactly, so, from 7 a.m. to 2 in the afternoon we’ll get everything set up. After that, we’ll have lunch and review the schedule so that everyone knows what’s going on. Once that’s done, we’ll head off to hike the Grassland trails for about three hours. And, from about 5 p.m. until lights out, we’ll do a nice dinner for everyone, share stories and teach everyone some camp fire songs.", "\nM: Sounds perfect. What about the second day?", "\nW: Well, it’s an early start that morning. Everyone should be ready to eat breakfast by 6. 7:30 to noon, we’ll float on the White Water River. Lunch will be served at noon and we’ll break down the camp starting at 1:30 p.m. After that’s finished, we’ll head back to town.", "\nM: Any equipment we should bring along?", "\nW: There’ll be life vests for everyone, but the part of White Water we’ll be floating is quite calm this time of year. As I’m sure Joan mentioned, everyone will need to bring a full set of camping gear. I’ve got a list here somewhere... Ok, each person should bring a tent, sleeping bag and pillow. For footwear, a pair of good, sturdy boots for hiking is best. Those can be worn for the rest of the trip, too, but I’d bring along some old shoes for the floating trip. As far as clothes go, just the normal stuff will be fine... jeans, some t-shirts, socks, that sort of thing. Um, remember also to bring some stuff in case of emergencies. Everyone will need a torch with extra batteries...", "M: A torch, huh? Unfortunately, ours just broke a couple of days ago. I’ll run to the shop tomorrow to grab a new one.", "\nW: No problem. Happens to everybody, sooner or later. While you’re there, you should probably buy some drinking water. Six large bottles per person should be plenty.", "\nM: Will the camping area have running water? Can’t we just use that?", "\nW: Yes, and it’s a clean supply, but not always reliable. And you’ll need to bring some along for the hike and float trip. Same goes for food. Although there’ll be plenty to eat for everyone, I’d definitely recommend bringing along an emergency food supply. You won’t regret it, I promise. I’d say one pack of whole grain snack bars. Also, please bring along a pack of matches and sharpfolding knife. We’ll go over basic knife safety and camp fire making at some point during Day 1...I forgot to mention that earlier, sorry.", "\nM: It’s fine. One of the main reasons Peter and I wanted to go on this trip was to learn some outdoor skills. Growing up in the city, I never learned any as a kid and think it’s important to pass this kind of knowledge down to the next generation.", "\nW: I couldn’t agree more. It’s easy to lose touch with nature and so many people miss out on opportunities until they’re simply too old to enjoy them anymore.", "\nM: No time like the present, eh? Joan mentioned something about the fees. There’s a deposit due pretty soon and we should probably bring some cash with us, right?", "\nW: That’s right. Since we’re going as a group, we get a special rate. The camp site fee’s 20 dollars and food’s 50, which includes your meals and drinks. Remember, lunch and dinner are provided on the first day and we’re doing breakfast and lunch on Day 2. The fees for hiking and floating are 5 and 20 dollars, respectively. So, its 95 dollars altogether. We’ll collect the fees in advance and the first 50 dollars is due two weeks before the trip. The remaining 45 will be collected before we leave from the library parking lot. Some folks have asked about refunds. Currently, there are no refunds just because we have out of pocket expenses for the bus rental, gas and food.

I’ve gotta say I’m encouraged by the number of people in our communities, both locally and in the province, who have shown up to provide help and support. First of all, I guess I should introduce myself. My name’s Robyn Lu and I’m the Director of the Shelter Society, which, of course, provides all sorts of vital assistance to the homeless population. Now, for some of you, this may very well be your first time to be here with us and I believe it’s necessary to understand a bit about the Society’s background and why it does what it does.", "Since opening its doors in 1953, the Society’s come a long way. It started in the basement of The Cedars restaurant over in Sidonville, just 20 miles from here. Fromthose most humble beginnings, though, things have really taken off. Headquartered in Camdenton, we now have offices in seven cities, including here in Carson City, and employ fifty full-time staff members. Nearly five hundred volunteers pull together, each and every year, to help the Society with its fund-raising and homeless assistance activities.", "Now, our mission statement includes not only providing the homeless with the assistance they need when they need it, but also a commitment to bettering their lives. I know that, when most people see homeless folks on the street, they look the other way or are just not sure if there’s anything they can do. But I’m here to tell you that this is a condition, however temporary, that can affect any of us at any time. Just look at the numbers. There are over 1000 homeless here and more than 50,000 in the province, representing a 50% increase in the last 10 years and 30% in the last five years alone. That by itself tells us there’s a pattern to the issue. And that pattern is economics, plain and simple. Our area manufacturing facilities have closed, charity funding is at an all-time low and cuts in government programs certainly haven’t helped matters.", "More and more of our citizens and former neighbors desperately need our help. Even if you can’t donate money because things are tight, donating your time is just as valuable...", "Let’s see, where was I...oh yes...this year’s charity drive is the most ambitious one yet. We have three absolutely outstanding staff members who are each responsible for different areas of the drive and our programs in general. Marla Sunderland, who comes from Vickson, is tasked with operating our food pantry and clothing donation programs. The food pantry helps people help themselves by offering items that can be taken away to be prepared and eaten at any time. As we’re always in need of more food for the pantry, Marla wanted me to say that, if you wish to help out, please donate any tinned items, such as soups and veggies and dry goods, like, uh, oatmeal, cereal and powdered milk.", "Clothing donations have increased this year and, even though we do end up cleaning all donated items thoroughly, we ask that you please donate only store- bought items or gently used ones.

It is my honor to address such a well-respected group of colleagues and civic leaders...and, though I wish I were here purely in the interests of science, I’m afraid that what I have to say has very serious implications for us all. For, in our present age, we often hear the name of great explorers used to describe the current stage of space exploration. Space agencies and other promoters of space travel regularly use these mythologies to create a sense of excitement and high adventure about the challenge of space.", "But behind the excitement of adventure, just as in the time of the explorers, lies the hidden layer of exploitation. Like the rulers in the past who paid for these excursions in hopes of greater economic rewards, there are forces in our world today lining up to harvest the benefits from the exploitation of the outer reaches.", "In his book, Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Space Rocks, Comets, and Planets, scientist John S. Lewis paints a picture of enormous profits to be made by nations that control the territory on the Moon, Mars, or other planetary bodies. For it is these planetary bodies, he maintains, that contain the untapped resources and riches of the future. Lewis says, and I quote \"...The global expansion of technology and civilization brought about by the age of Earth exploration is but a glimpse of the opportunities before us as humans move out into space.” Let’s take a step back and think about that for just one moment. Despite all the mundane news we hear about on a daily basis, we are, in a very real way, right now, even as we speak, engaged in a struggle for control over the future of the Earth and space itself. If we haven’t been deeply concerned up to now, we should be. We really should.", "A January 1995 New York Times article by science writer Lawrence Joseph entitled ‘Who Will Mine the Moon’, introduces us to the rare gas called Helium 3 and asks the telling question \"Will the Moon become the fuel-rich region of the 21st Century?\" Mr. Joseph concludes \"If we ignore the potential of this remarkable fuel, we could slip behind in the race for control of the global economy, and our destiny beyond.”", "Numerous voices, at space agencies and from private industry, are now calling for immediate action. David Gump, president of LunaCorp, recently made the case in a Space News piece when he said, \"Commercial activities should be the building blocks of the first Moon base, rather than afterthoughts. Discovery of the fabulously valuable buried ice fields at the Moon’s poles has dramatically increased the value of a Moon base, and the logic of a primary role for free enterprise.\"", "Ladies and gentlemen, I’m here to tell you that, indeed, much of the ground work for space exploitation is now being laid. The surface of the Moon has already been mapped by previous missions and Moon rovers are soon expected to drill for samples of Moon ice at the Moon’s north pole. Of course, if there’s wealth to be discovered, humans can and probably should seek it out, but, without proper legal controls and agreements between interested parties, we’re just asking for trouble.", "Another source of trouble on the horizon is the use of nuclear power for space exploration. Nuclear power has become the power source of choice for space agencies. Not only has the use of nuclear power for on-board generators for deep space missions been promoted, but there is growing evidence that the space exploration and exploitation \"adventure\" will soon be flooded with nuclear materials. Now, assuming that we wish to continue space missions with humans in control, how exactly are we going to ensure that the brave explorers of our time do not return home with health issues that are difficult and costly to resolve?", "One final concern is space junk. Yes, you’re heard me right...space junk. The more we explore and exploit space, the more junk we create. It’s as if we’re taking our problems on Earth, like pollution, and just expanding them to the infinite horizon. Studies have indicated that, within the next 10 years, space junk will be such a serious problem that any future of space tourism will be very much in doubt. So, as space resources will become more and more concentrated in the hands of large companies, regular folks who just want to have a look at the Moon or Mars may simply be unable to do so. Exploitation will have shut out exploration altogether. What a shame that would be...", "Space agencies and other promoters of space travel regularly use these mythologies to create a sense of excitement and high adventure about the challenge of space.", "Từ cần điền vào chỗ trống là một danh từ do đứng sau 'a sense of'.

However, to make sure that we can meet the\nproduction targets, we can’t avoid some waste. At busy times sometimes there’ll\nbe a stack of six burgers in the warming rack. We know these won’t stay at their\nbest for long, so after ten minutes they must go into the bin.\nAnother key area is\nefficient staffing.

This really helps us with efficiency of service and the\neconomy of the operation.", "Theo lời nói trong đoạn ghi âm, khi bàn về việc vận hành hoạt động kinh doanh (hay chính là vấn đề hiệu quả kinh doanh) thì yếu tố then chốt (key) đầu tiên đuợc nhắc đến là sự nhất quán. Mỗi chiếc bánh burger cần đồng đều về lượng nguyên liệu được sử dụng, thời gian chờ đồ ăn không quá hai phút để đảm bảo đúng tiêu chí đồ ăn nhanh. Không những vậy, để tránh lãng phí thực phẩm, doanh nghiệp thực hiện phân tích số liệu bán hàng nhằm dự đoán nhu cầu mỗi ngày và những thời gian cao điểm (tương ứng với đáp án B. knowing the busy times and days). Việc tránh lãng phí rõ ràng sẽ giúp ích cho hiệu suất kinh doanh nên ta chọn đáp án B.\nTuy nhiên nhà hàng không thể tránh hoàn toàn vấn đề đồ ăn thừa vì phải đảm bảo mục tiêu sản xuất. Dù vậy, trong thời gian cao điểm mà đồ ăn chuẩn bị trước quá 10 phút sẽ vẫn bị bỏ đi để đảm bảo chất lượng phục vụ (tương ứng với đáp án C. throwing away burgers after 10 minutes, tuy nhiên điều này không giúp tăng hiệu quả kinh doanh) nên loại đáp án C.\nMột yếu tố then chốt nữa (Another key area) trong vận hành doanh nghiệp là hiệu suất nhân sự. Nhà hàng có nhân sự toàn thời gian, nhưng nhân sự bán thời gian sẽ được thuê làm thêm vào các khoảng thời gian cao điểm (2 tiếng vào buổii trưa, 2 tiếng nữa từ 6 giờ tối), có thể điều phối thêm cả những nhân sự thường khác. Điều này góp phần vào hiệu suất kinh doanh và tính kinh tế của việc vận hành doanh nghiệp. Như vậy ta chọn đáp án D. hiring extra staff at key times.\nNgười nói có đề cập đến việc nhà hàng đào tạo nhân sự trong tất cả các công đoạn chuẩn bị nhưng trong thời gian cao điểm thì mỗi nhân sự chỉ đảm nhiệm một công đoạn trong quy trình. Đáp án E nói rằng chỉ đào tạo nhân viên ở một công đoạn nên loại E.\nNgười nói không nhắc đến mục tiêu về doanh số bán hàng nên ta loại đáp án A.\nTổng kết lại ta chọn đáp án B và D cho câu 14,15.", "I’m sure you’ve all seen our famous paper tray covers.

You both spent the last academic year on exchange programs at overseas universities. Now, at the start of this new semester I’d like to get some feedback from you to help us to provide more support to our exchange students in the future. Does that sound OK?", "Sounds fine to me.", "Me too. By the way, where were you Tom? I was in Germany.", "Oh, are you a languages student too? I was in Beijing studying Chinese.", "Wow, cool! Actually, I was studying management. All my lectures were in English, and my father’s German, so I felt very much at home.", "I actually wanted to get started by talking about day-to-day challenges Seems like you were able to adapt quite smoothly, Freya. How about you Tom, did you feel that the university provided enough support?", "Well, yes and no really. I mean, I did have a meeting with my course tutor which was quite useful, and I also remember reading some travel guides and the university’s own preparation booklet. However, it was my first time to travel independently to another country, and I don’t really think there is any program that can completely prepare someone for having to deal with living in a new country.", "That’s true, and in our booklet, it does mention the stages of culture shock, especially coping with the most difficult stage, stage 2, which sets in after two or three months.", "Yes, the negotiation stage isn’t it? Well, I’d been studying Chinese for a year before I went over to China and was considered one of the best students in the class, but suddenly I was in China and still using English all the time except in the classroom, It just made me feel really frustrated that my Chinese skills were still pretty limited and that I was too lazy to improve. Like you say, that period around three months was really hard. It just seemed like even the simplest things like going to the shops were incredibly difficult.", "But you managed to get through it?", "Well I didn’t have much choice! Yes, it was a pretty steep learning curve. It was mostly making friends with locals, forcing myself to use Chinese all the time andgetting more involved in campus activities... that did the trick. The second six months just flew by, and I can’t wait to go back at some point in the future.", "Great! So overall sounds like a pretty successful year, yeah?", "Yes, it was, on the whole.", "OK, let’s move on now to discuss in more detail some of the differences in the educational environment. Freya, shall we start with you? What were some of your main impressions?", "Well, the number of people attending lectures was much greater than I was used to, and the seminars were also quite large, so it was quite difficult to get direct feedback from tutors.", "And what about the learning process, was it similar to what you were used to?", "Pretty much. Like I said, all the classes were in English. I did notice something different when analyzing case studies though. For example, in the U.K. it seems generally more a case of trying to find the most practical solution, whereas in Germany there was much more focus on finding a model or framework to deal with the problem more effectively. That was a real eye-opener, and it’s definitely something to keep in mind in the future.", "So you mean that applying theory to practice is more common in German management training than in the U.K.? Interesting. Anything else? How about you, Tom?", "Thinking about the study side of things, um, was there anything in your experience of studying in China that surprised you or took a bit of getting used to?", "Well, I suppose the biggest challenge was that the teacher spoke in Chinese the whole time, and all the study materials were in Chinese, so there was no use of English to make things easier from time to time.", "Wow, sounds tough! And you were able to cope with that?", "Yes, eventually. Getting to know new people helped a lot as well, and as time went by we got together more often to do homework and practice together. That really helped a lot, especially as I’m more of a group learner.", "I can definitely relate to that, Tom, I learnt so much from other students, sometimes even more than from the teachers, just because we were all in the same boat and wanted to get the most out of being there.", "Great. Before we finish, any other tips for potential exchange students?", "Well, yes, I’d certainly recommend going to take a look at the place before you start the course, just as a tourist.

This semester, we are focusing on different approaches for understanding how employees can be motivated to perform well at their jobs. Today, we are going to be looking at a theory developed in the 1960s by a German psychologist named Frederick Herzberg, which has been very influential on management training courses. However, it is not without its drawbacks, as we shall see later.", "Now, the basic idea that Herzberg developed is that, in a given workplace, there are two types of factors at play. On the one hand, there are those factors that create increased job satisfaction, which Herzberg called the ‘motivators’. On the other hand, there are those aspects of a job that lead to increased dissatisfaction, which are labeled ‘hygiene’ factors. Having identified these two factors, these motivators and hygiene factors, Herzberg went on to state that a consequence of his theory was that the underlying reasons for job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction must be understood as independent of each other, hence the common name of this approach, the ‘two-factor theory’.", "Let’s firstly consider the former set of factors in more detail. What aspects of a job tend to motivate employees and thus bring about greater job satisfaction? Well, Herzberg’s own conclusions were not based on armchair speculation, but rather supported by research carried out within a variety of corporations. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he found that achievement was the number one factor leading to increased satisfaction. Obviously, everyone likes to be a success! This was followed by recognition, that is to say, having one’s contribution valued. The work itself, having more responsibility, and personal advancement, such as getting a promotion, completed the list.", "Now, some of you may have noticed something missing from the list that usually gets included when people give their main reasons for working hard - salary. So, why isn’t it there? Well, the answer is that, for Herzberg, salary is not a great motivator because any pay rise will never completely satisfy. Instead, it will eventually give rise to a demand for more money, while insufficient salary will contribute to the employee dissatisfaction.", "Apart from salary, what are some of the other factors leading to employee dissatisfaction? Well, again, based on Herzberg’s research, the findings tell us that company policy and administration, relationship with one’s supervisor, work conditions and how well the employee gets on with colleagues are also key ‘hygiene’ factors. However, it is perhaps not surprising that how well an individual interacts with the people around them will affect their degree of satisfaction with their job.", "Ok, so we have looked at the two different types of factors and discussed why, according to the theory, some factors increase employee satisfaction and some contribute to dissatisfaction. Before we move on, are there any questions?", "\nThus, according to the Two-Factor theory, we can find that there are four possible combinations. The ideal situation is high hygiene and high motivation, which means that employees are stimulated by their work and have few complaints. If only it were so easy! The second scenario is high hygiene and low motivation. Employees have no major issues with their work, but are not driven to improve themselves, and their focus is on the level of salary they receive. The third is low hygiene and high motivation. The job is stimulating and challenging, but the salary and working conditions are inadequate, which means that the employees have a lot of complaints. The fourth and worst set of circumstances is where the employees have both low hygiene and lowmotivation. This means both that the staff are not motivated and also that they have many complaints.", "Right, so having discussed the distinction between motivators and hygiene factors, what are some of the consequences of the theory? Well, in terms of increasing employee well-being, Herzberg thought that it was important to eliminate job dissatisfaction first before going onto creating conditions for job satisfaction. This is because otherwise they would work against each other. There are several ways to decrease dissatisfaction, but some of the most important ways are those discussed earlier, such as paying reasonable wages, ensuring employees job security, and creating a positive culture in the workplace, for example by using team building activities.", "However, eliminating dissatisfaction is only one half of the task of the two factor theory; the other half would be to increase satisfaction in the workplace. This can be done by improving on motivating factors, which are needed to stimulate an employee to achieve a higher level of performance. As previously mentioned, these often relate to opportunities for increased recognition, responsibilities and respect within the workplace, such as being assigned more challenging and rewarding tasks, or by achieving a promotion to a higher level position.", "\nOk, so in summary we can see that, according to this theory, what makes the employee happy in their job and what makes them unhappy exist as two separate sets of factors. However, is it really the case that factors relating to employee satisfaction in a workplace can be divided so neatly into two categories? Some critics have suggested otherwise. Let’s now move on to look at some of these criticisms, starting with...", "On the one hand, there are those factors that create increased job satisfaction, which Herzberg called the ‘motivators’.", "Từ cần điền vào chỗ trống là danh từ do tương đồng nghĩa với từ 'Factors'.

So, why do you want to join Best Fitness ?\nM: Well, that’s actually a bit of a long story. basically I’ve decided to raise some money for charity, for personal reasons, and I thought of several things to do, like organise a 24-hour football match, or have a cake sale.\nW: I see..\nM: But then my friends suggested I try and do a charity run and I thought yes, that’s a great idea, and then I thought, I need to join a gym!", "Đáp án cần điền là một danh từ do đứng sau mạo từ 'a'. Khi được hỏi về mục đích tham gia Best Fitness, người đàn ông kể rằng ban đầu anh ấy quyết định kêu gọi một số tiền để làm từ thiện vì một số mục đích cá nhân, và anh ấy đã nghĩ đến việc tổ chức một trận đấu bóng đá 24 tiếng hoặc bán bánh. Tuy nhiên sau đó những người bạn của anh ấy đã khuyên anh ấy thử tổ chức một giải chạy từ thiện (a charity run). Anh ấy nghĩ đó là ý hay, và nghĩ rằng mình cần phải đến phòng tập thể hình để chuẩn bị cho giải chạy đó. Như vậy cần điền 'Run' hoặc 'Charity run' vào chỗ trống.", "W: Haha! Absolutely, yes! Ok that’s great. I’m sure we can find the right course of training for you. Apart from that are you interested in any other activities?\nM: What have you got?\nW: What haven’t we got!

If you fancy yourself on the dance floor you can join our lessons every Thursday, learn to move to the music!", "Đáp án cần điền là phí thành viên hạng Silver mỗi tháng. Người đàn ông hỏi hạng Silver có được sử dụng hồ bơi không. Người phụ nữ đáp lại rằng gói thành viên Silver có được dùng hồ bơi và chỉ có mức giá bằng một nửa so với gói thành viên Gold (có giá 50 bảng Anh).

Người phụ nữ đề cập đến việc gói Silver có các quyền lợi mà gói Starter không có, cụ thể là lớp học nhảy vào mỗi thứ 5 hàng tuần. Hạng Gold có tất cả đặc quyền của hạng Silver và hơn thế nữa nên hạng Gold cũng bao gồm lớp học nhảy này.

Như vậy đặc quyền chỉ có ở hạng Gold là được sử dụng 'club lounge'.", "W: Yes, with Gold and Silver we ask you to renew your membership every year, every 12 months to be precise, but people who choose Starter are usually those who are not so serious about training, and obviously we want them to continue so..\nM: It’s a six-month renewal then.\nW: Actually, it’s three months! We think it encourages people to keep coming back.", "Đáp án cần điền là số tháng mà sau đó thành viên phải gia hạn lại hạng thẻ Starter. Theo lời người phụ nữ, hội viên Gold và Silver cần gia hạn mỗi năm. Còn hội viên Starter là những người thường không quá nghiêm túc với việc tập luyện nên trung tâm muốn thúc đẩy họ tiếp tục kiên trì bằng cách yêu cầu phải gia hạn mỗi 3 tháng.

You can get a discount there on other food and drinks – that’s included in the Silver package too, I forgot to say – but with Gold we also offer you one private session with one of our personal trainers – now that’ll really help your training!", "Đáp án cần điền là một danh từ vì đứng sau giới từ 'with', là thông tin về một buổi tập miễn phí chỉ dành cho hội viên hạng Gold. Người phụ nữ đề cập đến việc hội viên Silver sẽ được giảm giá ở nhà hàng, nghĩa là hạng Gold cũng đương nhiên có đặc quyền tương tự. Ngoài ra, hạng Gold còn bao gồm cả một buổi tập miễn phí với huấn luyện viên cá nhân (personal trainer).

Can anyone tell me when the castle was built? Anyone…what’s that I heard? 1520? Haha well, that’s what most people think! Actually, that was when it was constructed for a second time, after it was burnt down in 1502. No, the original castle was founded on this site in 1482, in the reign of Edward the Fourth", "Now does anyone know why the castle was built in the first place? Well, some of you might have noticed that the castle is positioned not on a hill but on a relatively flat piece of land near the River Brim, certainly not well-protected from invaders! Now then, if you look up at the tower you can see a series of little barred windows which suggest that prisoners were kept here, and certainly they were at some point, although this wasn’t the castle’s main function. No, perhaps surprisingly, the castle was in fact created by the second Lord Brimley as a present for his wife! Imagine if this had been built for your birthday!", "The running of the castle was taken over in 1872, and I’m afraid some of the descendants didn’t do a very good job. As you can see a large part of the main building, here, had to be rebuilt. The castle didn’t open its doors until 1964 even though the original plan had been to let in the public in 1924, then things were delayed even further by the war.", "Right, history lesson over for now, let’s have a look at some of the distinctive features. The tower is the obvious one; its style is such a good example of that time. And look at that magnificent window! Some of you also probably know the castle was the first in this region to have its own water-mill. But have another look at the glass up there! Yes the strangest thing is that when the sun shines, you can see reflections of the second Lord Brimley on the floor!", "So please have your fact sheets ready now as we move through the gardens. Now, cananyone see a dog? Yes? What about a snake? Well done! And look, there’s a sleeping lion. The most noticeable things about the gardens are these interestingly-formed hedges and bushes; we’ve counted over a hundred different animals in the grounds. What the gardens themselves are lacking, I’m sure you’ll agree, is any kind of distinctive water feature. The mill of course used to be a main attraction but the stream has long dried up and there are not currently any plans to re-route it, but, more excitingly, over the next year work will start on a river system through the lands, connecting the different ponds.", "Now, from here, there’s an excellent view of the tower, built in 1495. Towers in those days were built in the classic way, four sides usually, and sometimes eight, but can anyone tell me something curious about the tower on Brimley Castle? That’s right, there are only three walls, so it forms a kind of triangle. As you can see it needs some reconstruction and work will be under way in the next few months.", "Over there, you see the forest. We hope to finish a full nature survey of the area by next February but I can tell you there are over a thousand different plant and tree varieties -- and it’s also the site of some of our most interesting activities, like nature night walks and there is also an amazing tree house which pupils from Brimley school put up last year.", "And finally, we get to what remain of the castle walls, built after the main castle in 1490. They’re not very impressive now but I can tell you that when they were constructed they ran the whole way around the castle, approximately twelve metres high, in some places even higher than that. Early records state that this part, where we are now, stood an incredible fourteen metres, way above the rest! Soon this section will house the Wall tea-rooms, a perfect place for refreshment.

Anh ấy nghe thấy câu trả lời là năm 1520, tuy nhiên đây là khi lâu đài được xây lại lần 2 sau khi bị thiêu rụi vào năm 1502. Thực tế, toà lâu đài ban đầu được xây dựng vào năm 1482 dưới thời Edward đệ tứ trị vì.

Tuy nhiên, thực chất ban đầu lãnh chúa Brimley xây nên toà lâu đài này để tặng cho vợ của mình. Như vậy toà lâu đài vốn là một món quà, ta chọn đáp án A. a gift.", "The castle didn’t open its doors until 1964 even though the original plan had been to let in the public in 1924, then things were delayed even further by the war.\n", "Theo lời người hướng dẫn viên, đến tận năm 1964 thì toà lâu đài mới mở cửa đón du khách, mặc dù kế hoạch mở cửa ban đầu là từ năm 1924 nhưng bị hoãn lại do chiến tranh. Như vậy mốc thời gian mở cửa của toà lâu đài là năm 1964, ta chọn đáp án B.", "Right, history lesson over for now, let’s have a look at some of the distinctive features.

Điểm đặc biệt nữa là ô cửa sổ tuyệt đẹp mà điều kì diệu nhất là khi ánh nắng chiếu qua lớp kính sẽ cho thấy hình ảnh của lãnh chúa Brimley hiện lên trên mặt sàn.

Theo lời người hướng dẫn viên, cối xay nước từng là điểm thu hút chính, tuy nhiên dòng chảy đã cạn từ lâu và chưa có kế hoạch dẫn dòng mới. Mặc dù vậy, sẽ có một dự án xây dựng hệ thống sông (river system) mới sẽ được thực hiện trong 1 năm tới đây.

We had a big meeting last week and everyone cheered when it was announced; I think they’ve all had enough of the old place.", "Ha, yes it can get a little chilly in winter! Now, we are currently consulting with different interest groups. Obviously, students are going to be the main users of the library so any thoughts you guys can offer will be extremely valuable.", "OK, great. So, opening should be in around 9 months, is that right?", "Longer than that, about 18 months isn’t it?", "That’s right, Ben, although delays are also possible. Now, I just wanted to go over some of the key points in the document, things that will be of most interest to students.", "Fire away.", "Well, perhaps the biggest change for the new library is the open-plan design. We basically wanted to get away from having all the rooms separated from each other; that old traditional stuffy library atmosphere. Our plan is more like a shopping mall, with escalators taking students from one level to the next and then different browsing sections along the walls of each floor.", "Erm, but won’t it get a bit noisy?", "Well it might, but also on each floor there will be soundproof reading rooms, so there will be no noise coming in. These rooms will also contain individual pods that can be hired for an even more focused study experience.", "Oh, sounds impressive.", "Um, Liz, obviously nowadays with building design there are concerns about environmental impact, but I think I saw something in the plans about making use of green energy?", "That’s right! The library will have over 200 windows, including what will be the U.K.’s largest oval-shaped window at the top of the building, to allow as much natural light into the building as possible, good for sunny days! The roof of the building will also have a number of small wind turbines, and our target is that these will generate at least 20% of the energy needs of the building.", "Oh, that’s great.", "So, those are a few of the core features of the new library; so now feel free to ask any questions you have.", "Thanks. Well, as Ben mentioned earlier, a few questions came up in our meeting last week. Firstly, the proposal to get rid of a lot of the library computers is a concern for some.", "Well, yes, it’s true that we are reducing the number of provided computers to 30 from the previous 100. What we would prefer is for students to bring their own laptops, and we are significantly increasing the number of plug-in points for these.", " OK, that sounds reasonable. On a related point, Internet speed is something of an issue in the current place, especially when the library is full, presumably those problems will be ironed out?", "Yes, that is a priority, and also the local council have promised us extra funds - they want this to be a flagship project for Wi-Fi connectivity in the city, and the aim is to make it the fastest among national universities.", "Fantastic! Oh, another thing that came up was book availability - with the new building design it seems like the number of books on shelves at a given time will decrease.", "Yes, it’s true that we are moving away from rooms stuffed with books towards a more modern and spacious environment. However, we will still have the computer stations so that students can find and order books to borrow. Also, we are developing our digital library considerably.", "I was just about to ask about digital access! Erm, about seating - with the new place being more spacious will there still be room for chairs and tables? Lots of students like to be near the books when they are studying so they can just get up and grab something.", "Well, for browsing bookshelves, we are more likely to just be having benches, as our research shows that most users prefer a separation of browsing and study areas, but that’s something that can be adjusted if necessary.", "I also wanted to ask about disabled access, but we are waiting on feedback from a survey sent out to the Equal Access Committee.", "OK, but rest assured that easy access for people with disabilities is a priority for the project management team, especially things like wheelchair ramps.", "Liz, thanks again for meeting with us today, the new library sounds amazing!

Please take your seats and open your books to Chapter 3. Today, we’ll be talking about the ocean environment; specifically, The Great Pacific Garbage Patch. I know it’s a maybe a little strange to be talking about oceans and garbage at the same time. Generally, we think of broader terms, like pollution, when considering these areas of the Earth. But this garbage patch is actually a swirl of marine litter particles in the central North Pacific Ocean. It was discovered between 1985 and 1988 and extends over a very large but uncertain area. I say uncertain because its range depends on the degree of plastic concentration used to define the area. That is to say, the scientists measuring the density of these particles can’t always agree on what standard to use when considering an area to be polluted or not.", "Now, the patch itself is characterized by exceptionally high concentrations of ocean plastics, chemical waste and other litter that have been trapped by the currents of the North Pacific ocean. But, its low density prevents detection by satellite photography or people in the area. The structure and movement of the ocean’s waters push and hold this litter together over time.", "The great Pacific garbage patch was first described in a 1988 research paper based on results obtained in the mid 1980s. What they did was measure plastic in the North Pacific Ocean, finding high concentrations of marine litter piling up in regions controlled by ocean currents. They then used their findings from the Sea of Japan to estimate that similar conditions would occur in other parts of the Pacific where the main currents were favorable to the creation of relatively stable waters. Turns out they were right.", "It was a Mister Curtis Meyer, that’s M-E-Y-E-R, who actually named the region of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and we’ve been using that name, ever since. Of course, that name is used whenever the area is featured in media reports as an exceptional example of marine pollution. But, even up close, the patch is not easily seen because it consists of tiny pieces almost invisible to the naked eye. Most of its contents are trapped beneath the surface of the ocean due to the structure and movement of currents mentioned just a moment ago. More recently, a similar patch was found in the Atlantic Ocean by a Mister Christopher Norman, N-O-R-M-A-N, and, as you might imagine, is called the North Atlantic garbage patch. We scientists are a creative bunch!", "Moving on, it is thought that, like other areas of concentrated marine litter in the world's oceans, the Great Pacific garbage patch formed gradually as a result of ocean or marine pollution gathered by oceanic currents. As you can see on page 83 in your books, the garbage patch occupies a large and relatively stable region of the North Pacific Ocean. The rotational pattern of the currents in this region draws in waste material from across the North Pacific Ocean, including the coastal waters off both North America and Japan. As material is captured in the currents, wind-driven surface currents gradually move floating litter toward the center, trapping it in the region.", "Despite some strong opinions, there’s actually no definite scientific data concerning the origins of ocean plastics. In a study published in 2014, researchers sampled many locations throughout the world’s oceans and determined that discarding fishing gear, such as buoys, lines, and nets, accounted for more than 60% of the mass of plastic marine litter. A 2011 report indicated, and I quote, \"The primary source of marine litter is the improper waste disposal or management of garbage and manufacturing products, including plastics from littering and illegal dumping... this litter is generated on land at ports, rivers, harbors, docks, and storm drains and at sea from fishing vessels, fixed platforms and transport ships.” That’s a lot of potential sources, so it’s really just too difficult to find and blame any one industry or country. If we could do that, we might be able to get someone to clean it all up. But, as it stands, that’s simply not the case.", "I suppose that the most shocking part of all this is the size of the garbage patch. Estimates of size range from 700,000 square kilometers, about the size of Texas in the U.S., to more than 15,000,000 square kilometers, which is up to 8% of the size of the entire Pacific Ocean, or, in some media reports, up to twice the size of the continental United States. Such estimates, however, are uncertain, given the complexities of sampling and the need to compare findings against other areas. Finally, although the size of the patch is determined by a higher-than-normal degree of concentration of ocean litter, there is no standard for determining the boundary between normal and elevated levels of pollutants to provide a firm estimate of the affected area.", "Today, we’ll be talking about the ocean environment; specifically, The Great Pacific Garbage Patch. I know it’s a maybe a little strange to be talking about oceans and garbage at the same time. Generally, we think of broader terms, like pollution, when considering these areas of the Earth.

Theo lời đoạn ghi âm, một trong những cách phổ biến nhất để quản trị nhân lực làm việc tuân theo quy tắc của công ty là bằng cách đề ra những mục tiêu về thành tích (achievement targets) như số tiền kiếm được, những sản phẩm được phát triển hoặc số khách hàng tăng thêm. Như vậy 'achievement' là từ cần điền vào chỗ trống.", "These targets are a useful\nguideline, but they have a downside. Young enthusiastic staff will be very keen to meet\nthese targets, and some of them might potentially use illegal means or behave\nunethically in order to meet requirements — for example, by offering bribes to gain\nsales, or making their sales numbers or earnings look higher than they are, or even\nthreatening or criticising other staff to get a job completed. Achievement targets are\noften linked directly to performance bonuses, and this can make a bad situation worse.", "Đáp án cần điền là một danh từ vì đứng sau cụm 'tied in to'. Những mục tiêu thành tích được đề ra là một sự định hướng hữu ích, tuy nhiên vẫn có nhược điểm. Đội ngũ nhân sự trẻ nhiệt tình sẽ rất muốn đạt được những mục tiêu này và một số người trong số họ có thể hành động phi pháp hoặc hành xử phi đạo đức để đạt chỉ tiêu — ví dụ như hối lộ để đạt doanh số bán hàng, hoặc khai khống doanh số bán hàng hoặc thu nhập cao hơn thực tế, hoặc thậm chí đe dọa hoặc chỉ trích nhân viên khác để hoàn thành công việc. Mục tiêu thành tích thường có liên hệ trực tiếp với tiền thưởng hiệu suất (performance bonuses) và điều đó có thể làm cho vấn nạn này tệ hơn. Như vậy từ cần điền vào chỗ trống là 'performance bonuses'.", "Robert Simons, writing in the\nHarvard Business Review, has added some new concepts to the thorny problem of\nencouraging creativity while maintaining a viable business.

Đòn bẩy đầu tiên mà Robert Simons đề xuất là việc cho người lao động tích cực tham gia vào tập quán của doanh nghiệp.

Is there some new product seducing your customers?\nThis lever is called ‘interactive control’.", "Đáp án cần tìm là tên gọi của đòn bẩy thứ ba được Robert Simons đề cập đến.

Well, a survey carried out in the nineteen eighties confirmed that this owl is most likely to be found inwoodland. If you look at a map of tawny owl distribution across Britain, you’ll only see gaps in the treeless marshy areas of eastern England, and in some of the more upland parts of north-west Scotland. However, you can sometimes find populations of tawny owls in urban areas too, either in parks or in large gardens.", "The tawny owl shows some obvious adaptations to its natural habitat. For example, both its wings and itstailare short, which helps it to manoeuvre through the trees. Also the bird’s plumage is a mixture of brown andgrey, and this provides suitable camouflage for when the owl perches up against a tree trunk. Then, there are its large eyes. The tawny owl's visual capacities are considerably better than those ofhumans, and although it can’t see in complete darkness, it’s sufficiently well equipped to be able to navigate its way around woodland on all but the most overcast nights. Another factor that contributes to the tawny owl's success as a hunter, is its excellentmemoryof the layout of different areas. If you combine this ability with the owl’s strongly territorial and sedentary nature - most populations of tawny owl are 'sit and wait’ predators - you realise that it has a good opportunity to predict where prey might be found. Finally, as well as having large eyes, the owl’s sense ofhearingis excellent, and this helps it to locate potential prey as it sits on its perch.", "Turning now to the tawny owl’s diet ... Woodland tawny owls feed mainly on mammals,especially small ones such as wood mice and bank voles. But they’ll also take things like frogs, or bats or even fish, if they happen to be available. In urbanised landscapes, the owls seem to prey more onbirds. So there are some differences there.", "Let’s just look briefly now at survival rates in the tawny owl. Young tawny owls face a difficult time once they leave home, and two out of every three are likely to die within their firstyear. So with such high mortality levels it’s a good job that established breeding pairs can produce young over a number of seasons, and maximise their chances of passing their genes on to the next generation of owls.", "I’ve already mentioned the sedentary nature of the tawny owl. But it’s not just adult tawny owls that are sedentary in their habits. Young birds, dispersing away from where they were born, rarely move far - the average distance is just four kilometres. There also appears to be some reluctance to cross large bodies ofwater- the owl is absent from many of the islands around our shores, with only occasional sightings in Ireland and the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England.", "Right, well, now I’ll show you some photographs that have been taken in ..."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the notes below.", "Write ONE WORD ONLY for each answer.", "Most (31) ________ owl species in UK", "Strongly nocturnal", "Habitat", "Mainly lives in (32) ________, but can also be seen in urban areas, e.g. parks.", "Adaptations:", "Diet", "Main food is small mammals.", "Owls in urban areas eat more (38) ________", "Survival", "Two thirds of young owls die within a (39) ________", "Owls don’t disperse over long distances.", "Owls seem to dislike flying over large areas of (40) ________"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "common"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "woodland/woods/forest(s)"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "tail"}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "grey/gray"}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "humans/people"}, {"question_number": "36", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "memory"}, {"question_number": "37", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "hearing"}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "birds"}, {"question_number": "39", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "year"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "water"}]}]}]},

She wasn’t a film maker herself - she’d actually been a very energetic tourism development officer for many years - but Adbourne had run a classical music festival which had been becoming less and less popular in recent years ... Joanne was looking around for something to replace it and touse funds allocated to it to promote something which local people can enjoy.", "Great. So tell us about the festival nowadays ...", "Well, it’s held in the last two weeks of August every year and short films from all over the world are shown in three places - in the theatre and our two cinemas. Several films are shown in one performance and the whole thing lasts about ninety minutes.Tickets are very reasonably priced - under twelves used to get in for fifty pee but now we charge just one pound which is still very good value! One pound fifty for students and two pounds fifty for everyone else. Performances are advertised all round town and also on our website", ". If you’re interested in attending any performancesyou can buy tickets online of course and you can also get them in the library, which is right next to the main shopping area - I’m afraid this year, tickets are no longer available from either of the two cinemas because of restricted opening times.", "I understand you also run a film competition?", "Yes, for under eighteens. We have a different theme every year. Last year for example, the theme was ‘Future Planet’ and the winner was a ten minute documentary encouraging youngsters to be more aware of environmental issues,focusing on getting school kids to cycle to school instead of going by car. This year the theme is ‘Sporting Nation’ - so there’ll also be lots of ideas to choose from. Now we’re always on the look-out for new local talent so if you live in the Adbourne area and are under eighteen, you should have a go. We have an excellent prize every year, donated by local businesses - shops, hotels etc. This year you can win ahi-spec movie cameraworth over eight hundred pounds. Application forms are on the website and the deadline for sending in your film to enter the competition is the last day ofJuly. It’s May now so you’ll have the whole of June to be working on it!", "And what are the judges looking for?", "Well, although we choose very topical issues like the environment, we’re not looking for", "- you know, trying to get people to do something.Instead we’re looking for a new angle ... a fresh way of looking at a theme. And of course, because it’s a short-film festival, it’s not really about a fully worked story with well-rounded characters, it’s more aboutgood photography... conveying things visually.", "And who judges the films?", "A panel of three people who know a lot about film. We’ve used the same judges for many years and we’re very happy with their expertise. One thing we probably will change nextyear though iswe want to add another class and another prize for older film makers. We’ll keep it at a maximum of ten minutes though ... the length works well for our festival.

For my presentation today I’m going to report on an assignmentthat I did recently. My brief was to analyse the methods used in a small study about job satisfaction, and then to make recommendations for future studies of a similar kind.", "The study that I looked at had investigated the relationship between differences in gender and differences in working hours, and levels of job satisfaction amongst workers. For this purpose, employees at acall centrehad been asked to complete a questionnaire about their work.", "I’ll summarise the findings of that study briefly now. First of all, female full-time workers reported slightly higher levels of job satisfaction than male full-time workers. Secondly, female part-time workers reported slightly higher levels of satisfaction than female full­time ones did. On the other hand, male part-time workers experienced slightly less job satisfaction than male full-time workers. But although these results seemed interesting, and capable of being explained, perhaps the most important thing to mention here is that in statistical terms they wereinconclusive.", "Personally, I was surprised that the findings hadn’t been more definite, because I would have expected to find that men and women as well as full and part-time workers would experience different levels of satisfaction. So I then looked more carefully at themethodologyemployed by the researchers, to see where there may have been problems. This is what I found.", "First of all, the size of the sample was probably too small. The overall total of workers who took part in the survey was two hundred twenty-three, which sounds quite a lot, but they had to be divided up into sub-groups. Also the numbers in the different sub-groups wereunequal. For example, there were one hundred fifty-four workers in the full-time group, but only sixty-nine in the part-time group. And amongst this part-time group, only ten were male, compared to fifty-nine who werefemale.", "Secondly, although quite a large number of people had been asked to take part in the survey, theresponsewas disappointingly low - a lot of them just ignored the invitation. And workers who did respond may have differed in important respects from those who didn’t. Thirdly, as the questionnaires had been posted to the call centre for distribution, the researchers had had very limitedcontrolover the conditions in which participants completed them. For instance, their responses to questions may have been influenced by the views of their colleagues. All these problems may have biased the results.", "In the last part of my assignment I made recommendations for a similar study, attemptingto remove the problems that I’ve just mentioned.", "Firstly, a much largersampleshould be targeted, and care should be taken to ensure that equal numbers of both genders, and both full and part-time workers, are surveyed. Secondly, the researchers should ensure that they are present to administer thequestionnaires to the workers themselves. And they should require the workers to complete the questionnaire under supervised conditions, so that the possibility of influence fromother colleaguesis eliminated. Finally, as workers may be unwilling to provide details of their job satisfaction when they are on work premises, it’s important that the researchers reassure them that their responses will remainconfidential, and also that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time if they want to. By taking measures like these, the reliability of the responses to the questionnaires is likely to be increased, and any comparisons that are made are likely to be more valid.", "So that was a summary of my assignment.

I’ve been asked to talk to you this afternoon about next month’s trip toTamerton Study Centre for the two-week course. Now some of the things I’m going say you may have already heard or read about ... but I think it’s important to emphasise a few key points.", "First of all, it’s worth reminding you why Tamerton was set up in the first place ... in the late nineteen sixties. That was really before all the concern with preserving the environment which everyone talks about these days.The idea was simply to get people out of the cities and into the country and to find out that just being outdoors can be very rewarding.", "This is not going to be a holiday in the usual sense. It’s called an adventure course because you’ll really be stretched to your limits but that in itself can be a positive thing. The group I took last year, for example, said that although they actually felt pretty weak and exhausted all the time,it really made them learn a lot about themselves and increased their confidence... and in the end that’s the most important thing.", "Now all of you knew about policies at Tamerton before you signed up for it, so you know that in many ways it’s quite old fashioned - you don’t have a lot of choice in what you do. Butsomething which I think makes the place so special is that you get to try so many different things, every day. For instance, one day you’ll do climbing and the next you’ll be surveying rock pools. It’s not intended that you become an expert in any of them ... it’s more like a taster, which you can follow up if you want.", "And there isn’t a lot of free time ... organised activities and talks, etc. go on until nine p.m. and lights go out at eleven p.m. There are table tennis tables, with all the equipment, andboard games, though I have to say the pieces often go missing so it’s a good idea to take your own.There’s a DVD player with a good selection of films suitable for this age group so don’t take yours.", "Bed-time at eleven p.m. is strictly enforced ... and there’s a good reason for this.You’re all under eighteen and we organisers need to know that all group members are accounted for in the house as we close for the night.And of course you’ll be so exhausted anyway that you’ll be too sleepy to want to cause any trouble.", "Leader: Now, what should you pack? The information sheet tells you a lot about what clothing tobring ... but what about other things? Well, Tamerton House has its own small shop, but anything bigger is several miles away so you won’t have many opportunities for buying supplies. So in this last part of my talk, I’m going to explain what objects you should take with you to the Centre, what you can take if you want and also, very importantly, what you cannot take.", "Several of you came up to me before this talk and askedwhether you can take things like kettles, or hairdryers. The answer is, there are plenty ofthese electrical appliances availablein the Centreand they are of the proper voltage and are checked regularly. Yours may not be, so the rules at Tamerton sayyou can’t bring them into the Centre... because it’s considered a fire risk ... remember it’s a very old house. Now, another question was aboutcell phones.Although you definitely can’t have them on during inside talks, you equally definitely need them when you’re out on exercises ... sothey’re a must, I’m afraid. Anybody who wishes to talk to me about borrowing a phone for the fortnight, please see me after this talk.", "Now, the weather’s heating up at the moment and you’ll be outdoors a great deal. If you wear proper clothing, especially a hat,sun cream is optional. Also they sell high-factor cream in the shop so you don’t have to take any of your own, unless there’s a special kind you use. Now there’s a special note about things likedeodorants which come in aerosol cans - I need to tell you that these are banned in the Centrebecause apparently they have the habit of setting off the fire alarms. If you want to take an aerosol can, you’ll actually be at risk of being told to leave.", "And finally, people having been asking about whether they need to taketowels. Well, the Centre does provide one towel per guest, which you’re required to wash yourself.If you’re happy with that then don’t bring another. If not, take one of your own.

I’ll start by introducing the concept,giving some background and so forth and then I’ll go on to explain the technological applications, including a short, very simple, experiment I conducted.", "Starting with the background ... As everyone knows, all living creatures need oxygen to live. Mammals take in oxygen from the atmosphere by using their lungs, and fishes take oxygen from water by means of their gills, which of course in most fishes are located either side of their head.", "But human beings have always dreamt of being able to swim underwater like the fishes, breathing without the help of oxygen tanks. I don’t know whether any of you have done any scuba diving but it’s a real pain having to use all that equipment. You need special training, and it’s generally agreed that tanks are tooheavyand big to enable most people to move and work comfortably underwater. So scientists are trying a different tack: rather than humans carrying an oxygen supply as they go underwater, wouldn’t it possible to extract oxygen in situ, that is, directly from the water, whilst swimming?", "In the nineteen sixties the famous underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau, for example, predicted that one daysurgerycould be used to equip humans with gills. He believed our lungs could be bypassed and we would learn to live underwater just as naturally as we live on land. But of course, most of us would prefer not to go to such extremes.", "I’ve been looking at some fairly simple technologies developed to extract oxygen from water - ways to produce a simple, practical artificial gill enabling humans to live and breathe in water without harm. Now, how scientists and inventors went about this was to look at the way different animals handled this - fairly obviously they looked at the way fishes breathe but also how they move down and float up to the surface using inflatable sacs, called swim bladders. Scientists also looked at animals without gills, which use bubbles of air underwater,", "beetles. These insects contrive to stay underwater for long periods by breathing from this bubble which they hold under their wing cases.", "By looking at these animal adaptations, inventors began to come up with their own ‘artificialgills’. Now making a crude gill is actually rather easy - more straightforward than you would think. You take a watertight box ... which is made of a material which is permeable togas, that is, it allows it to", "inwards and outwards. You then fill this with air, fix it to the diver’s face and go down underwater. But a crucial factor is that the diver has to keep the watermoving, so that water high in oxygen is always in contact with the gill, so he can’t really stay still. And to maximise this contact it’s necessary for your gill to have a bigsurface area. Different gill designers have addressed this problem in different ways but many choose to use a network or lattice-arrangement of", "tubesas part of their artificial gills. Then the diver is able to breathe in and out - oxygen from the water passes through the outer walls of the gill and carbon-dioxide is expelled. In a nut-shell, that’s how the artificial gill works.", "So, having read about these simple gill mechanisms, I decided to create my own. I followed the procedure I’ve just described and it worked pretty well when I tried it out in the swimming pool ... I lasted underwater for nearly forty minutes! However, I’ve read about other people breathing through their gill for several hours.", "So the basic idea works well, but the real limitation is that these simple gills don’t work as the diver descends to any great depth because thepressurebuilds and a whole different set of problems are caused by that ... Research is being done into how these problems might be overcome . but that’s another story which has to be the subject of another talk!", "Despite this serious limitation, many people have high hopes for the artificial gill and they think it might have applications beyond simply enabling an individual to stay underwater for a length of time. For example, the same technology might be used to provide oxygen forsubmarines... enabling them to stay submerged for months on end without resorting to potentially dangerous technologies such as nuclear power. Another idea is to use oxygen derived from the water as energy forfuelcells. These could power machinery underwater, such as robotic devices ...", "So, in my view, this is an area of technology with great potential.

Some people think that there might not be that much going on as far as an and music and dancing and so on are concerned, because it's so remote. I mean, we don't really get things like theatre and opera in the same way as-cities down in the south like Sydney, for example, because of the transport expenses.But in fact what happens is that we just do it ourselveslots of people play music, classical as well as pop, and there are things like artists groups and writers groups and dance classes - everyone does something, we don't just sit and watch other people.", "You said it's very international?", "Yeah, they say there's over 70 different nationalities in Darwin. For instance, there's been a Chinese population there for over 100 years we've even got a Chinese temple. It was built way back in 1887, buterm, when a very bad storm a a cyclone in fact hit Darwin in the 1970s it was almost completely destroyed. The only parts of the temple that survived were part of the altars and the stone lions, butafter the storm they reconstructed it usingmodern materials. . it’s still used as a religious centre today, but it's open to tourists too and it’s definitely worth going to see it. Oh and as far as getting around goes, you'll see places that advertise bicycles for hire, but I wouldn't recommend it.A lot of the year it's just so hotand humid. Some tourists think it'll be fine because there's not much in the way of hills, and the traffic's quite light compared with some places, but believe me, you're better off with, public transport it's fine, and not expensive. Or you can hire a car, but it's not really worth it.", "What's the swimming like?", "Well, there are some good beaches, but the trouble is that there's this nasty creature called the box jellyfish and if it stings you, you're in bad trouble. So you have to be very careful most of the year especially in the winter months.. You can wear a lycra suit to cover your arms and legs, but I wouldn't like to risk it even so, personally. And there are the salt water crocodiles too.I mean, I don't want to put you off.there are protected swimming areas netted off where you'll be safefrom jellyfish and crocs, or there are the public swimming pools, they're fine of course.", "So which places would you specially recommend?", "Well, one of the most popular attractions is called'Aquascene'. What happens is every day at high tide hundreds of fish come in from the sea - all different sorts, including some really, big deep-sea fish - and some of them will even take food from yourhand. It's right in the middle of town, at the end of the Esplanade. It's not free - I think you have to pay about five dollars but it's definitely something you have to experience. Then of course Darwin has a great range of food, being such acosmopolitan place. And if you don't have lots to spend, the best place to go is to Smith Street Mall where they have stalls selling stuff to eat, there's all sorts of different things including south-east Asian dishes, which I really like. You'd think there'd be plenty of fresh fish in Darwin as it’s on the coast, but in fact because of the climate it mostly gets frozen straight away, but youcan get fresh fish in the restaurants on Culien Bay Marina - it's a nice place to go for a special mealand they have some good shops in that area too. What else, well, there'sthebotanic garden: it’s over a hundred years old and there's lots to see an orchid farm,rainforest, a collection of palm trees, erm. a wetlands area you can easily spend an afternoon there. That's atFannie Bay. a couple of kilometres out to the north. Then, if you've got any energy leftin the evening, the place to go is Mitchell Street that's where it all happens as far as clubs and music and things are concerned- you'll bump into lots of my friends there!

Ah yes. Stella is Phil there too? Good. Come on in. OK, so you’re here to discuss your research project. Have you decided what to focus on?You were thinking of something about the causes of mood changes, weren't you?", "Yes, but the last time we saw you, you suggested we narrowed it down to either the effects of weather or urban environment, so we've decided to focus on the effects of weather", "Right. That's more manageable. So. your goal is ...Phil?", "To prove the hypothesis no, toinvestigatethe hypothesis that the weather has an effect on a person's mood.", "Mmm. Good And what's your thesis? Stella?", "Well, our thesis is that in general, when the weather's good it has a positive effect on a person's mood and bad weather has a negative effect.", "Mmm Can you define your terms here - for example, what do you mean by ‘good' and 'bad'?", "OK. Well, good would besunny, warmweather and bad would be when it's cold and cloudy or raining", "And how would you define an effect on a person's mood?

But first, what about background reading?I gave you some suggestions did you manage to read any of it ?", "Yes - we read the Ross Vickers article the one comparing the groups of American Marines training in summer and winter. That's quite relevant to our study, t was interesting because the Marines who were training in the cold winter conditions tried to cheer themselves up by thinking of warm places, but it didn’t really work.", "Yes, they were tryingto force themselves to have a positive mental outlook but in fact it had the opposite effect, and they ended up in a very negative state of mind.", "And we found some more research by someone who wasn't on the reading list you gave us - George Whitebourne. He compared people living in three countries with very different climatic conditions. Actually he looked at several things, not just the weather,but he found some people's reactions to bad weather were much worse than others and it was linked to how stressed they were generally - the weather on its own didn't have such a significant effect on mood.", "And we looked at a paper by Haver.", "Havedon.", "Yeah. He broke weather up into about fifteen or sixteen categories and did qualitative and quantitative research, he found that humans respond to conditions in the weather withimmediate responses, such as fear or amazement, but these responses can also be linked to associations from their earlier life, such as a particular happy or sad event.", "Did you have a look at Stanfield's work?", "Yes. It was interesting because the type of questions he asked were similar to what we were planning to use in our survey.", "Yes?", "He asked people how they were feeling on days with good and had weather.He found the biggest factor seemed to be the humidity moods were most negative on days with a lot of rainfall. Long periods without sunshine had some effect but nothing like as much.", "Mmm That could be quite a useful model for your project.", "Yes. we thought so loo - although. We can't continue our survey for as long as he did - he d d his over a six- month period.", "Right, well, you've made quite a good start. So, where are you going from here?", "Well, we’ve already made the questionnaire we're going to use for the survey - it’s quite short, just eight questions.

It seems like common sense but do these ideas have any theoretical basis? Today, I want to look at the situation in the USAand at some of the research that has been done here in America on the effects of reducing class sizes. In the last couple of decades or so, there has been considerable concern in the United States over educational standards here, following revelations thatthe country's secondary school students perform poorly relative to Asian and European students. In addition, statistics have shownthat students in the nation's lower income schools in the urban areas have achievement levels far below thoseof middle-class and upper middle-class schools.", "So would reducing class sizes solve these problems?", "Well, we have to remember that it does have one obvious drawback, it’s expensive. It requires more teachers and possibly more classrooms, equipment, and so on. On the other hand, it smaller classes really do work, the eventual economic benefits could be huge.Better education would mean that workers did their jobs more efficiently, saving the country millions of dollars, it would also mean that people were betterinformed about their health, bringing savings m things like medical costs and days off sick.", "So what reliable information do we have about the effects of reducing class sizes?There's plenty of anecdotal evidence about the effect on students' behaviour. But what reliable evidence do we have for this?", "Let's have a look at three research projects that have been carried out in the USA in the last couple of decades or so. The first study I'm going to look at took place in the state of Tennessee in the late 1980s. It involved some 70 schools. In its first year about 6,400 students were involved, and by the end of the study, four years later, the total number involved had grown to12,000. What happened was that students entering kindergarten were randomly assigned lo either small classes of 13 to 17 students or regular-size classes of 27 to 26. The students remained in whatever category they had been assigned to through the third grade, and then after that they joined a regular classroom.", "After the study ended in 1989, researchers conducted dozens of analyses of the data. Researchers agree that there was significant benefit for students in attending smaller classes, and it also appears that the beneficial effect was stronger forminoritystudents. However, there's no agreement on the implications of this we still don't know the answer to questions like how long students have to be in smaller classes to get a benefit and how big that benefit is, for example.", "The second project was much larger and took place in California. Like the Tennessee study, it focused on students from kindergarten through to grade 3, but in this case,allschools throughout the state were involved. The experiment is still continuing, but results have been very inconclusive, with very little improvement noted. And the project has in fact also had several negative aspects.", "It meant an increased demand forteachersin almost all California districts, so the better-paying districts got a lot of the best teachers - including a fair number that moved over from the poorer districts. And there were a lot of other problems with the project - for example, there weren't any effective procedures forevaluation. All in all, this project stands as a model of what not to do in a major research project.", "A third initiative took place in the state of Wisconsin at around the same time as the California project began, and it's interesting to compare the two. The Wisconsin project was small class sizes were reduced in just 14 schools - but it was noteworthy because it targeted schools at which a significant proportion of the students were frompoorfamilies, compared with California's one-size- fits-all approach. Analysts have found that the results are very similar to the Tennessee project, with students making gains that are statistically significant and that are considerably larger than those calculated for the California initiative.", "Now, I'd like to apply some of these ideas to...."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Choose TWO letters A-F", "Which TWO of the following problems are causing concern to educational authorities in the USA?"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "A/D"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "A/D"}]}, {"context": ["Choose TWO letters A-F", "According to the speaker, what are two advantages of reducing class sizes?", ""], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "33", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "B/E"}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "B/E"}]}, {"context": ["Complete the table below.", "Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER for each answer.", "State", "Schools involved", "Number of students participating", "Key findings", "Problems", "Tennessee", "about 70 schools", "in total  (35) ________", "significant benefit especially for  (36) ________ pupils", "• lack of agreement on implications of data", "California", "(37) ________ schools", "1.8 million", "very little benefit", "•  shortage of  (38) ________, especially in poorer areas", "•  no proper method for  (39) ________ of project", "Wisconsin", "14 schools (with pupils from  (40) ________ families)", "similar results to Tennessee project"], "context_table": [["State", "Schools involved", "Number of students participating", "Key findings", "Problems"], ["Tennessee", "about 70 schools", "in total   (35) ________", "significant benefit especially for   (36) ________  pupils", "• lack of agreement on implications of data"], ["California", "(37) ________  schools", "1.8 million", "very little benefit", "•  shortage of   (38) ________ , especially in poorer areas •  no proper method for   (39) ________  of project"], ["Wisconsin", "14 schools (with pupils from   (40) ________  families)", "", "similar results to Tennessee project", ""]], "type": "table", "questions": [{"question_number": "35", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "12000/12,000 [OR] 12/twelve thousand"}, {"question_number": "36", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "minority"}, {"question_number": "37", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "all"}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "teachers"}, {"question_number": "39", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(the) evaluation"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "poor"}]}]}]},

So I'll begin by giving you a brief overview of his life, and then you can explore the town at your leisure.", "Well, Manjiro Nakahama,as he was then known, was born in1827 in a village by the sea in what is now Tosashimizu in Japan. And like many people in that town, he became afishermanwhen he was just a youngster.", "One day in 1841, when he was just 14 years old, he and some others were fishing tar off the coast of Japan when they were caught in a storm and shipwrecked on a small deserted island. They had to wait forsix monthsbefore they were rescued by an American whale ship that had stopped at the island by chance. Four of the five Japanese were put ashore in Hawaii, but Manjiro had become friends with thecaptain. William Whitfield, who came from the town of Fairhaven, where we are now, and he chose to remain aboard, and to return with the boat to the USA. So Manjiro unwittingly became the first Japanese ever to set foot on American soil. He came back right here to Fairhaven with Whitfield, and stayed with the Whitfield family who paid for hiseducationhere in the town. He studied Mathematics and Geography as well as shipbuilding and navigation. But he missed his mother, and his own country, and eventually he went back to Japan where he had a responsible position as a university teacher and also served an invaluable role asinterpreterduring the initiation of relations between Japan and the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century.", "But the most interesting thing is that the links between Tosashimizu and Fairhaven have remained and grown stronger over the years, in spite of the distance between them, and in fact the two places now have the official status ofsister cities. Both places are ports, so in fact the inhabitants have a lot in common. There have been a number of visits by the inhabitants of Tosashimizu, in particular at the time of theFestival, which is held every two years here in Fairhaven to celebrate the life and achievements of John Manjiro. It takes place in the fall, arid there's an ever-growing programme including drumming, singing, martial arts, and stalls selling Japanese and American food. So if you're going to be in the region around then, it’s really worth a visit.", "Now many of the buildings that Manjiro Nakahama knew in Fairhaven are still standing today, and so if you'd just like to hand round some copies of this map I'll suggest the best route to follow to see them. OK, so if you look at the bottom of the map you can see the Millicent Library, and that's where we are now Now to fellow the John Manjiro trail, you go out of here along Center Street, and then head up Main Street until you get to Pilgrim Avenue. Go down there and turn right at the end, go straight on andjust on the corner with Oxford Street you’ll see a two- storey house This is the Whitfield family house, and this is where Manjiro first stayed when he came to Fairhaven. It's still a private residence, so please respect the owner's privacy. OK Now, if you carry on along Oxford Street, then turn left at the end,you'll come to North Street, andabout half-waydown there is what's known as OldOxford SchoolThis was the very same school that Manjiro attended when he lived here It was considered to be the best school in town because of the quality of the buildingunusually, it was built of stone - and the quality of the teaching.

So tell me, you finished your Fashion Design course in London four years ago did you think of carrying straight on and doing a higher degree at the time?", "Yes but there were financial pressures. So I ended up working in the retail industry, as you can see from my CV. And actually it was a very useful experience.", "Mmm Iri what way?", "Well, I was lucky to get the job with FashionNow-they're a big store, and, one of my priorities was toget as much experience as possible in different areas, so that was good because I had the chance to work in lots of different departments.And having direct contact with the customersmeant I was able to see how they reacted to innovation-to new fashion ideas, because with FashionNow, a designer might show something in New York or Milan and there'll be something similar in the shop within weeks.So, that was probablythe most useful thing for me.", "Right. And so what's made you decide to do a postgraduate course now?", "Erm . Well, while I enjoyed working at FashionNowand I learned a lot there, I felt .. well, the way forward would have been to develop my managerial skills rather than my skills infashion design, and I'm not sure that's what I want to do.", "Mmm, yes.", "When I was doing my degree in London I'd been interested in women's wear. But know that there’s been a lot of work done in areas like new fabric construction- and though I'm not intending to go too deeply into the technologyI'd be very interested in looking at how new fabrics could be used in children's wear, so I'd like the chance to pursue that line.", "Yes. Good. And are you at all concerned about what'sgoing to be like coming back into an academic context after being away from it for several years?", "No, I'm looking forward to it. But I'm basically more interested in the application than the theory or at least that's what I've found so far, and I'm hoping the course will give me the contacts and skills I need eventuallyto set up my own enterpriseI'm particularly interested by the overseas links that the department has.", "Yes, many of our students look overseas or to international companies for sponsorship of their projects.", "And the facilities here look excellent. I just went to look at the library - it'sreally impressive. There's so much room compared with the one at my old university.", "Yes, most students find it's a good place to study. And there are linkups to other universities, of course, and all the usual electronic sourcesthe staff run an Information Skills Programme which we recommend all postgraduates do in the first week or two.Design students find the Special Collections particularly useful.", "Yes.", "Then we have a separate Computer Centre, which has its own academic coordinator, Tim Spender-he's got a background in art design, andthe ethos of the centre is that it's a studio for innovation and creativity, rather than a computer laboratory.", "Oh, right, i liked the study spaces where students can sit and discuss work together very useful for joint projects We always had to do that sort of thing in the cafeteria when l was an undergraduate. And I read in the brochure that there's a separate resource for photography.", "Yes, it's called Photomedia. It's not just for photography, but things like digital imaging and new media. It's a resource for all our students, not just fashion design, and we encourage students to work there producingwork that crosses disciplinary boundaries. It's well used in fact, it's doubled in size since it was set up three years ago. And we also have an offshoot from that which is called Time Based Media - this is for students who want to develop their ideas in the area of the moving image or sound. That's ina new building that was speciallybuiltfor it just last year, but there are plans to expand it as the present facilities are overstretched already.", "Right.", "Now. is there anything you'd like to ask about the course itself?", "Erm, ... I know it’s a combination of taught modules and a specialist project, but how does assessment lit in?", "Well, as you'd expect on a course of this nature, it's an ongoing process. The degree course has four stages, and there are what we callprogress reviewsat the end of each of the first three. Then the final assessment is based on your project. You have to produce a report which is acritical reflectionon your work.", "And is there some sort of fashion show?", "There's anexhibition.

Well, when someone laughs you've got movement of the muscles of the face and the chest, and you've got sound formed when the air’s forced out of the body as part of this process, so we’re talking about aphysicalactivity. But obviously other things are involved as well and this is where it gets more complicated. Laughing isn’t something that you normally decide to do. so it’s not voluntary behaviour, like ordinary speech. Instead it’s regulated by ourinstinctsrather like the singing of a bird, or the roaring of a lion. And once you start to laugh, it can be quite hard to stop that's not always under your conscious control either.", "But why do we laugh? Because we find something funny, most of us would say. But in fact it appears that laughter has little to do with jokes or funny stories only about 10 percent of laughter is caused by things like that. One suggestion is that human laughter may have originally started out as a shared response to signalreliefat the passing of danger. And it's true that even these days,laughter’s rarely an activity carried outby an individual on his or her own. In fact, people are 30 times more likely to laugh when they're with other people than when they're completely alone. Laughter still seems to be a kind of social signal, it occurs when people are in a group and they're comfortable with one another And it seems likely that laughter can result in the creation ofbondsbetween the people in the group.", "And it's precisely because of this social aspect of laughter that people like public speakers and politicians often try to get their audience to laugh it encourages their listeners to trust them and to connect with them. But this kindof thing - controlling the laughter of a group, that is indicates that there's a link between laughter andpower, and this is supported by several studies that indicate that bosses use humour more than their employees. And research has also shown that female listeners are likely to laugh much more if the speaker is male, so it appears that there are gender issues associated with how much we laugh", "I should also point out that laughter can he used as anegativesignal as well as a positive one. I think we've all probably seen evidence of a group using laughter to exclude someone ... to emphasise that they are not accepted. So it's not always a positive type of behaviour, either. So what all this goes to show is that laughter is a very, very complex issue.", "It does appear however that laughter has definite benefits. If we look first at the psychological aspects, we know that people often tend to store negative emotions, such as anger, sadness and fear, rather than expressing them, and il seems that laughter provides a harmless way for thereleaseof those emotions. But there are also clear physical effects that have been monitored too. For example, laughter is good aerobic exercise - it speeds up heart rate and respiration, and raises blood pressure; one researcher suggests that 100 laughs a day is the equivalent of 10 minutes' jogging.", "Laughter also helps prevent the stress that so many people suffer from today, which results from the faster pace of life and all that goes with il It does this by reducing the levels ofhormonesin the blood which are caused by stress. And, in addition, it is known to increase the levels of chemicals that protect the body from infection or pain and so it helps to boost theimmune system.One interesting study showed that people who had had surgical operations asked for fewer pain killers if they'd been viewing comic films. In fact, research has even shown that the quality of dreams can be positively affected by laughter - a good laugh 10 minutes before going to sleep can prevent you from havingbad dreamsand give a much more pleasant and restorative night's sleep, So. there's now little argument that finding things funny and enjoying a good laugh is extremely beneficial to us all.", "What we need to consider now are the ways in which laughter can be used as a treatment for people who..."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the notes below.", "Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer.", "The nature of laughter", "Reasons for laughter", "Benefits of laughter"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "physical"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "instincts"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "relief"}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(social) bonds"}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "power"}, {"question_number": "36", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "negative"}, {"question_number": "37", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "release"}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "hormones"}, {"question_number": "39", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "immune system"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "bad dreams"}]}]}]},

This has to be led right from the beginning. Assertive road positioning and behaviour is the key to safe cycling incongested urban environments.

Anyway, no one commented on that under content, but one thing that diet come out was thatthey liked the fact we'd done research on both Northern Ireland and China, most other people had just based their research on one country. We managed to get quite a lot of data from the Internet, although we had to do our own analysis and we did our own surveys as well in both countries. So the class gave us best feedback for content but it was all OK.", "Right. Well, that's quite similar to the feedback I’m giving you.

For my presentation, I’d like to look at some examples of what cities are doing to try tosolvesome of these problems.", "As part of its healthy city programme, the World Health Organisation the WHO has come up with a set of criteria for a healthycity. The WHO says, that amongst other things, a healthy city must provide a clean environment which is alsosafeit mustn't be dirty, or dangerous for its inhabitants. As well as that, the WHO says a healthy city has got to be able to satisfy its inhabitants'basic needsthat'sallits inhabitants, not just the rich ones or the ones with jobs. Everyone who lives there. A third thing a third criterion, is that it's got to have health services which can be used by all the inhabitants, and which they can access easily. The final point's to do withlocal governmentthe WHO says this is something that the whole community should be involved in, not just a few powerful politicians or businessmen. So, a healthy city's not just a matter of avoiding illness, that sort of 'healthiness', it's the way that the whole city works together for the benefit of its population.", "So what I'd like to do now is to look at some projects in different cities around the world where cities have tried to meet these criteria to make their cities 'healthy' ones.", "Right, the first project I'm going to discuss took place in SriLanka, and this project was called the 'Community Contracts System'. Its aim was to improve the places where the poorest section of the population lived - the squatter settlements. Basically, the problem was lack of infrastructure things like drains, paths, wells for water and so on. So, a programme was set in place to construct this infrastructure, but what was different aboutwas that theresidentsdid this the people who actually lived there, not people from outside. And this meant that not only did the people end up with improved housing and infrastructure, but also because they had contracts with the community, it improved their chances from aneconomicpoint of view. So that's a way the lives of people in one urban environment were improved.", "The next project I'd like to discuss took place in the capital city of Mali, in West Africa. This project involved setting up a cooperative to try to solve the problems of sanitation in the old central quarters of the city. One of the main problems was a lack of a system for garbage collection, which meant that there were a lot of insects, and this was causing disease. And again it's interesting to look at who was involved in dealing with this problem-in this case, the cooperative involved students who had graduated fromsecondary schoolipgetting a system going. As well as that, the cooperative set up a campaign to educate the public about the importance of good sanitation, through showingfilmsand setting up discussion groups among the local people, especially women and adolescents. And the outcome was an increased environmental awareness which led to changes in household behaviour as well as improved living conditions.", "OK, the third project was in Egypt, just outside the capital, Cairo, which is a city that's grown very rapidly in the last few decades. This project was based in aWomen's Centrein a poor area called Mokattam. The aim of the project was to support girls ... young women from the area from poor families, so these were women who had no education, they’d never been to school, so they were totally illiterate, and they had no chance of getting jobs.", "At the Women’s Centre, they were shown how lo sew and how to weave, and once they'd learned theseskills,they were given the equipment, a sewing machine or a loom-so that they could make things to sell, and have a chance of earning their own living. And this project has meant that these young women have greaterstatusin the community, but as well as that, they can enjoy a better quality of life.", "So I don’t think the problem is that cities are bad. This world and its citieshave the resources lo provide for the population that lives there.

Well, amongst the items on display will be some exciting pieces of modern jewellery, furniture, ceramics,metal workand sculpture. To give you some examples ... Local artist Kate Maine will be there to discuss her collection of pots and bowlsthat she has made to resemble garden vegetables. They're the sort of thing that would brighten up any dining table, and range from things like yellow cabbage-shaped bowls to round tomato­shaped teapots. Prize-winner Cynthia Course, will also be there to talk about her silver jewellery, all of which she produced using ideas from the rural setting of her country home. Some of her rings are quite extraordinaryand have beautiful coloured stones in them. Or if you prefer sculpture, there's plenty of that too. Take, for example, Susan Cup's sculpture of25 pairs of white papershoes. It sounds easy, but believe me it looks incredible! All of these items along with many others will be on sale-throughout the exhibition period.", "As part of the exhibition, there will bea series of demonstrations called 'Face to Face'which will take place every Sunday afternoon during the exhibition and these will provide an opportunity for you to meet the artists.", "The second set of activities are for those who would prefer to indulge in some artwork themselves ... the Artist's Conservatory are holding a series of courses over the autumn period. The courses cover all media and include subjects such as Chinese brush painting,pencil drawingand silk painting. All the tutors are experienced artists, course sizes are kept to a minimum of 15 and there will be plenty of individual assistance.", "All the sessions offer excellent value for money and the opportunity to relax in a delightful rural setting.

Delighted to be here.", "First of all, can you give us a quick overview of the history of the bear family?", "Well, the bears we know today actuallyhave as their ancestors bears which have been evolving for some 40 million years. We have fossils of the earliest 'true bear' - and it's important to emphasise this because some creatures are called bears but are not ...", "... such as koalas for instance.", "Yes exactly ... fossils of the true bear show a small dog-size animal with characteristics that show ablending of dog and bear traits.", "So the general belief is thatdogs and bears were of the same family?", "Yes, that's the theory. And then we see the arrival of the early Cave Bear. We know from cave drawings that Neanderthal man used to worship this bear and at the same time fear it.", "Understandable perhaps ...", "Yes, but they need not have worried because theCave Bear only ate plants. In fact the Cave Bear survived two Ice Ages but then became extinct.", "So how many bears can we find today and are any of them in danger of extinction?", "Well I'll answer your first question first. There are eight species of bear in all; among them the American Black Bear and the Brown Bear - from which evolvedthe newest species of bear - the Polar Bear.", "So how old is the Polar Bear?", "Oh, he's a relative newcomer - just 20,000 years old.", "And could you tell us a little about them? Which is the largest bear, for instance?", "Well, the largest bear existing today is either the Polar Bear or the Brown Bear.", "Right ... Don't we know?", "Well, it depends which criteria you use. The Polar Bear is the heaviest; the male weighs up to 1,500 pounds but his narrow body actually makes him look smaller than the much more robust Brown Bear.", "So theBrown Bear appears the biggest.", "Yes.", "And the smallest?", "Well, theSun Bear is the smallestof the eight species. They only weigh between 60 and 145 pounds.", "That makes him a comparative junior!", "Yes. And then next we have the so-called Giant Panda ... but that's a small bear too, comparatively speaking.", "And are all bears meat eaters?", "No, not at all. In fact theGiant Panda is almost entirely herbivorousliving on a diet of 30 types of bamboo.", "Oh, yes of course. Panda's are famous for that.", "And another interesting bear is theSloth Bear which eats insects, particularly termites. He can turn his mouth into a tube and suck the insects out of their nests.", "So going back to my second question ... Are bears really in danger of extinction?", "Yes indeed ... they are ... the Sun Bear in particular as they've been hunted almost out of existence. And the habitat of the Panda is also being reduced on a daily basis.", "Can anything be done to reduce the threat to these endangered species? I know for instance that it's very hard to breed bears in captivity.", "Yes, well ... I think that by raising people's awareness generally we can reduce conflict between humans and animals ...to stop the slaughter in parts of the world where bears are still hunted- supposedly in self- defense or to protect livestock, but ... often quite unnecessarily. Andwe can also encourage governments to preserve the natural environment of the bearrather than allow the areas where they live to be systematically destroyed in the name of progress.", "Yes, of course.", "And in addition to these global efforts, all profits fromthe sale of my book will go towards the United Nations Bear Protection program.", "That's wonderful ... and with the news coming up, thank you for your time, Alison, and best of luck with the book...", "Thank you very much."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the sentences below.", "Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "21", "question_text": "According to Alison Sharp, bear ancestors date back  (21) ________ years.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "forty/40 million"}, {"question_number": "22", "question_text": "Scientists think bears were originally in the same family as  (22) ________.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "dogs [OR] the dog"}, {"question_number": "23", "question_text": "The Cave Bear was not dangerous because it  (23) ________.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(only) (ate) plants"}]}, {"context": ["Choose the correct bear species in each question.", "Which is the most recent species?", "(24) ________", "Which is the largest looking bear?", "(25) ________", "Which is the smallest bear?", "(26) ________", "Which bear eats plants?", "(27) ________", "Which bear eats insects?", "(28) ________"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "24", "question_text": "Which is the most recent species?", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(The) Polar Bear"}, {"question_number": "25", "question_text": "Which is the largest looking bear?", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(The) Brown Bear"}, {"question_number": "26", "question_text": "Which is the smallest bear?", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(The) Sun bear"}, {"question_number": "27", "question_text": "Which bear eats plants?", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(The) Giant Panda"}, {"question_number": "28", "question_text": "Which bear eats insects?", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(The) Sloth Bear"}]}, {"context": ["Check TWO letters A-F.", "Which TWO actions are mentioned to help bears survive?"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "29", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "B/E"}, {"question_number": "30", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "B/E"}]}]}, {"audio_url": "https://s4-media1.study4.com/media/plus_media/audio/1_Practice-20Test-205_sec4.mp3", "transcript": ["Good evening and welcome to this month's Observatory Club lecture. I'm Donald Mackie and I'm here to talk to you about the solar eclipse in history.", "A thousand years ago, a total eclipse of the sun was a terrifying religious experience - but these days an eclipse is more likely to beviewed as a tourist attractionthan as a scientific or spiritual event. People will travel literally miles to be in the right place at the right time - to get the best view of their eclipse.", "Well. What exactly causes a solar eclipse - when the world goes dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day? Scientifically speaking,the dark spot itself is easy to explain: it is the shadow of the moon streaking across the earth. This happens every year or two, each time along a different and, to all intents and purposes, a seemingly random piece of the globe.", "In the past people often interpreted an eclipse as a danger signal heralding disaster and in fact,the Chinese were so disturbed by these eventsthat they included among their gods one whose job it was to prevent eclipses. But whether or not you are superstitious or take a purely scientific view, our earthly eclipses are special in three ways.", "Firstly, there can be no doubt that they are very beautiful. It's as if a deep blue curtain had fallen over the daytime sky as the sun becomes a black void surrounded by the glow of its outer atmosphere.", "But beyond this, total eclipses possess a second more compelling beautyin the eves of us scientists ... for they offer a unique opportunity for research. Only during an eclipse can we study the corona and other dim things that are normally lost in the sun's glare.", "And thirdly, they are rare. Even though an eclipse of the sun occurs somewhere on earth every year or two, if you sit in your garden and wait, it will take 375 years on average for one to come to you.If the moon were any larger, eclipses would become a monthly bore: if it were smaller, they simply would not be possible.", "The ancient Babylonian priests, who spent a fair bit of time staring at the sky, had already noted that there was an 18- year pattern in their recurrencebut they didn't have the mathematicsto predict an eclipse accurately. It was Edmund Halley, the English astronomer, who knew his maths well enough to predict the return of the comet which, incidentally bears his name, and in 1715 he becamethe first person to make an accurate eclipse prediction.", "This brought eclipses firmly into the scientific domain and they have since allowed a number of important scientific discoveries to be made. For instance, in the eclipse of 1868 two scientists, Janssen and Lockyer, were observing the sun's atmosphere and it was these observations that ultimatelyled to the discovery of a new element. They named the elementheliumafter the Greek god of the sun. This was a major find, because helium turned out to be the most common element in the universe after hydrogen. Another great triumph involved Mercury ... I'll just put that up on the board for you now. See - there's Mercury - the planet closest to the Sun - then Venus, Earth, etc. For centuries, scientists had been unable to understand why Mercury appeared to rotate faster than it should. Some astronomers suggested that there might be an undiscovered planet causing this unusual orbit and even gave it the name 'Vulcan'. During the eclipse of 1878, an American astronomer,James Watson, thought he had spotted this so-called 'lost' planet. But, alas for him, he was later obliged to admit that he had been wrong about Vulcan and withdrew his claim.", "Then Albert Einstein came on the scene.

Einstein's theory of relativity - for which he is so famous - disagreed with Newton's law of gravity in just the right way to explain Mercury's odd orbit.

My job is to tell you all about the amazing little kiwi - and your job, hopefully, is to dig deep in your pockets.", "Now for the benefit of our overseas visitors here today, I should explain first of all that the kiwi is the national bird of New Zealand - and sometimes New Zealanders themselves are known as 'Kiwis'. Now, while kiwis in the wild are a rare sight, the kiwi as a symbol is far more visible. Apart from being in toy stores and airport shops all over the world, you'll find them on ourstamps and coins. The kiwi is the smallest member of the genus Apteryx which also includes ostriches and emu.It gets its name from its shrill call which sounds very much like this- kee-wee kee-wee. Kiwis live in forests or swamps and feed on insects, worms, snails and berries. It's a nocturnal bird with limited sight and therefore it has to rely on its verykeen sense of smellto find food and to sense danger. Its nostrils are actually right on the end of its long beak which is one third of the body length. Now here's an interesting fact. Although kiwis have wings, they serve little purpose becausethe kiwi is a flightless bird.", "Since white settlement of the islands, kiwi numbers have dropped from 12 million to less than 70,000 and our national bird is rapidly becoming an endangered species. This is because they're beingthreatened by what we call introduced animalsanimals which were brought to New Zealand such as cats and ferrets which eat kiwi eggs and their chicks.", "And so we have launched the Kiwi Recovery Programme; in an all-out effort to save our national bird from extinction. There are three stages to this Programme: Firstly, we have thescientific researchstage - this involves research to find out more about what kiwis need to survive in the wild. Then secondly we have the action stage. This is where we go into the field and actually put our knowledge to work - we call this putting science into practice, and then we come to the third stage - theglobal educationstage. By working with schools and groups like yourself, as well as through our award winning kiwi website we are hoping to educate people about the plight of the kiwi.", "As part of the action stage, which I just mentioned, we have introduced 'Operation Nest Egg' and this is where your money will be going. It works like this: It's a three- stage process. First of all, we go out to the kiwi's natural habitat and wecollect kiwi eggs. This is the tricky part because it can be very difficult to find the eggs. Then, in safe surroundings, away from predators ... thechicks are reared. Now this can be done on predator-free islands or in captivity - they're reared until they are about nine months old at which stage the chicks are returned to the wild. So far it's proving successful and since we started the programme some 34 chicks have been successfully raised this year and their chances of survival have increased from5 to 85%. However, it's not time to celebrate kiwi survival just yet. About 95% of kiwi chicks still don't make it to six months of age without protection. Which is why Operation Nest Egg is so important and we ask you to give generously today."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the notes below.", "Use NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer.", "Pictures of kiwis are found on  (11) ________", "The name ‘kiwi’ comes from its  (12) ________", "The kiwi has poor sight but a good  (13) ________", "Kiwis cannot  (14) ________", "Kiwis are endangered by  (15) ________"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "11", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "stamps and coins"}, {"question_number": "12", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(shrill) call"}, {"question_number": "13", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(sense of) smell"}, {"question_number": "14", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "fly"}, {"question_number": "15", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "introduced animals"}]}, {"context": ["Complete the notes below.", "Use NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS for each answer.", "Stage of program", "Program involves", "(16) ________", "Looking at kiwi survival needs", "Action", "Putting science into practice", "(17) ________", "Schools and the website"], "context_table": [["Kiwi Recovery Program Stage of program Program involves  (16) ________ Looking at kiwi survival needs Action Putting science into practice  (17) ________ Schools and the website", "Stage of program", "Program involves", "(16) ________", "Looking at kiwi survival needs", "Action", "Putting science into practice", "(17) ________", "Schools and the website"], ["Stage of program", "Program involves"], ["(16) ________", "Looking at kiwi survival needs"], ["Action", "Putting science into practice"], ["(17) ________", "Schools and the website"]], "type": "table", "questions": [{"question_number": "16", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(scientific) research"}, {"question_number": "17", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "global education"}]}, {"context": ["Complete the flow chart below.", "Use NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS or A NUMBER for each answer.", "OPERATION NEST EGG"], "context_table": [["People   (18) ________"], [""], ["(19) ________"], [""], ["Chicks returned to wild"], [""], ["RESULT"], ["Survial rate increased from 5% -   (20) ________"]], "type": "table", "questions": [{"question_number": "18", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "collect (kiwi) eggs"}, {"question_number": "19", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "chicks (are) reared"}, {"question_number": "20", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "85%"}]}]}, {"audio_url": "https://s4-media1.study4.com/media/plus_media/audio/1_Practice-20Test-204_sec3.mp3", "transcript": ["We're very pleased to welcome Professor Isaac Nebworth to our tutorial group today and he's come to share one of his pet passions with us - City traffic and our western dependence on the motor car.

But do super highways automatically lead to super wealth, as our politicians would have us believe? I think not.", "Can you give us an example of what you mean exactly?", "Sure ... well, by continuing to encourage this dependence on the motor car, we simply create more congestionand more urban sprawl. And you can see that here in Melbourne right under your nose.", "Excuse me. I would just like to say that I feel the sprawl is part of the city.

I use the freeway all the time. I think it's great.", "Ah yes, but it cost $2billion to build, and you could have gotten ten times the value by putting the money into public transport. If yougive the automobile road space, it will fill that space... and you'll soon find you'll be crawling along your City Link.", "But surely, you cannot simply blame the car. Some of the blame must rest with governments and city planners?", "Student: Well there is an argument, surely, that building good roads is actually beneficial because most new cars these days are highly efficient - they use far lesspetrol than in the past and emissions of dangerous oases are low. Old congested roads, on the other hand, encourage traffic to move slowly and it's the stationary cars that cause the pollution and smog ... whereas good roads increase traffic speeds and thus the amount of time cars are actually on the roads.", "Well ... this is the old argument put forward by the road lobby but, for me it's clear cut. Roads equal cars which equal smog. Public transport is the way to go.", "Now ... on that topic of public transport, I read somewhere recently that Australia isn't doing too badly in the challenge to increase the use of public transport.", "Better than America, granted, but by comparison with Canada, it's not so good. For instance, if you compare Toronto with the US metropolis of Detroit only 160 kilometres away ... in Detroit only 1% of passenger travel is by public transport whereas in Toronto it's 24% which is considerably better thanSydney which can only boast 16%.", "Well I think it's encouraging that our least car- dependent city is actually our largest city. 16% of trips being taken on public transport in Sydney, isn't too bad.", "But it's a long way behind Europe. Take both London and Paris for instance ... where 30% of all trips taken are on public transport.", "Well, they do both have an excellent underground system.", "... andFrankfurt comes in higher still at 32%.", "I understand that they've been very successful in Copenhagen at ridding the city of the car. Can you tell us anything about that experiment?", "Yes indeed. Copenhagen is a wonderful example of a city that has learnt to live without the motor car. Back in the 1960s they adopted a number of policies designed to draw people back into the city. For instance theypaid musicians and artists to perform in the streets.They also built cycle lanes and now 30% of the inhabitants of Copenhagen use a bicycle to go to work. Sydney by comparison can only boast 1% of the population cycling to work.", "It could have something to do with all the hills!", "Then they banned cars from many parts of the city andevery year 3% of the city parking is removedand by constantly reducing parking they've created public spaces and clean air.", "Really!!", "There are also freely available bicycles which you can hire for practically nothing. And of course, they have an excellent public transport system.", "Well, that's all very well for Copenhagen. But I'd just like to say that some cities are just too large for a decent public transport system to work well. Particularly in areas with low population, because if there aren't many people using theservice then they don't schedule enough buses or trains for that route.", "I accept that there is a vicious circle here but people do need to support the system.", "And secondlythe whole process takes so long because usually you have to change ... you know, from bus to train - that sort of thing, and that can be quite difficult. Ultimately it's much easier to jump in your car. And often it turns out to be cheaper.", "Sure ... but cheaper for whom, you or society?

Well, apart from keeping it fresh for our daily needs, many foods, such as fruit and vegetables are only available at certain times of the year so if we want to be able to eat these foods all year round, we need to preserve them. We also need topreserve food for export overseasto make sure that it doesn't perish in transit, and lastly we need to be able to preserve food for when there arefood shortages. There are a number of methods of preserving food which involve both high and low temperatures, chemicals, irradiation and drying. Let's have a look at these in turn.", "In the 1870s the French scientist, Louis Pasteur, showed that micro-organisms in food could be destroyed by raising the temperature of the food - a process now known as pasteurisation. This involves heating milk to just 65°C for 30 minutes. A new method, the ultra-high temperature or UHT process, involves heating milk to 150°C for three seconds. The advantage of treating milk in this way is that itlasts much longerthough I tend to feel, and I'm sure many of you would agree, that taste is somewhat sacrificed in the UHT process.", "Tin cans were first used in the early 1800s to store and preserve food. Just as they are now, the cans were tin­plated, steel containers and the process had the advantage of being cost effective.Unfortunately, however, there were many early cases of food-poisoningbecause the canning process was not fully understood at that stage. We now know the exact temperature and length of time each food needs for proper preservation which has greatly reduced the risk of food-poisoning.", "People living in cold climates often preserved food by burying it in the snow and the Romans knew all about the advantages of packing food in ice but for most people this was not an option until the invention of the refrigerator in 1834. Today, however, refrigeration is the most important means of preserving food because the food stays fresh without needing to be treated. However,refrigeration requires an electricity supplyand unfortunately if the power goes off, so does the food!!", "A variety of chemicalscan be added to food and you'll find their names listed on the labels of cans and bottles. Salt is probably the oldest of all the chemical preservatives and was used by many ancient civilisations for many years.", "Sugar also acts as a preservative and is used to preserve jams in much the same way that vinegar is used to pickle foods. Chemical preservatives are effective but they do not suit all foods and the processes involved are time- consuming.", "Another method of preserving food is by drying it. Most foods are 75% to 90% water so if you remove the water the micro-organisms simply can't survive. When food is dried it not only lasts a long time but it also becomes much lighter which is a big advantage as thismakes it cheap to store, though some people argue that valuable nutrients are lost in the process. Early methods for drying food involved cutting it into strips and hanging it in the sun or over fires. But there are now a number of more modern methods which involve the use of recent technology. One of these is known as roller drying and it's a highly effective way of making dried foods from liquids, such as soup.", "Have a look at this diagram to see how it works. Well, first of allthe hot soup is pouredin at one end - here. The liquid spreads to form a thin layeron a heated belt. The liquid dries as it moves along. By the time it reaches the end of the belt, all the water has evaporated leavingonly dry powder. A blade then scrapes the dried material off the roller andcaptures it in powder form.

You do have over a hundred to choose from, they're mostly sandy beaches and they vary from the largest which is two and a half kilometres long, to tiny sandy coves. But there are a few that I'd really recommend you to visit.", "So looking at this pamphlet, first of all there's Bandela beach. This beach is one kilometre away from the oldfishing villageof Bandela ... which is a beautiful spot. If you park in the car park behind it, there's a small path which leads down to the bay. It's very pretty because the whole beach is backed bypine treesso its very sheltered. The beach itself is very clean and the water is shallow and safe. That together with the soft sand make it an ideal beach for children and non-swimmers.", "A little further round the coast, again to the east ... in the eastern corner of the island, is the spectacular Da Porlata beach which is basically a long inlet. The land around this beach ismarshland... it's all marsh ... and there's a stream which winds through it and the stream goes into the sea ... and the beach has lovely pale gold sand. Access to this beach is quite tricky and not for the less energetic! You have to go down a long flight of steps - 190 to be exact. But you'll be relieved to know that there's also a road which winds down to a car parking area. When you're level with the sea, there is a handful of shops and bars and you can hiresunbeds and umbrellas.", "Continuing round the island, just past the Tip of Cain is the next beach I'd suggest you visit and this is San Gett. Why? Becausethere isn't a beach longer than thison the island. If you want to know, it's exactly two and a half kilometres long and that's a bonus because it means it never gets overcrowded. It has golden sand and clear, blue water shelving into the sea. There are several beach restaurants to choose from and watersports are available when the water is calm. But check first. This beach operates aflag systemas the sea can get rough and you should always swim between the flags. There's a large car park which gives you easy access to the eastern end of the beach but the western end is much quieter and more wild as it is harder to reach. Blanaka is another popular beach -just in thenorth-westcorner of the island. It has incredibly white sand and sparkling water. There is ample car parking here and plenty of bars and restaurants. Blanaka haswhite cliffsall around jt and for those of you who'd like a little more to do than just lazing on the beach, there are caves here which you can explore in the cliffs and you can also dive into the water from rock platforms along the side of the cove.", "Well, my final recommendation for today is Dissidor. Now this beach isn't quite as easy to get to as the others I've talked about. It's quite a remote little beach tucked away here next to Blanaka. You can reach Dissidor by a steep slope which goes over somesandbanks. The beach itself is small and pretty, with reddish-coloured sand and some stony areas on its eastern side. Despite being quite small the bathing is good and you can also go fishing here from the rocks at either side.

We do.", "How do you manage to make sure that you're going to have the books students need when all the new courses begin?", "Basically, we make preparations long before theyarrive. Like all other major book retailers, we have a database of information, and using that, we contact course convenors in May and ask them to send us theirbooklists.", "How many books are we talking about?", "For one course?", "Yes, as an example.", "An average course requires about 30 books. We ask lecturers to indicate whether a book is what we call 'essential' reading ... you know, the students simply have to get it ... or whether it's what they would term 'recommended' reading or whether it's just a supplementary text that they tend to refer to as 'background' reading.", "What about predicted buyers?", "It's not a perfect system unfortunately. If a lecturer tells us that he expects us to sell 100 copies of a book, we know that we could actually sell anything from 50 to 150. That's why in practice, when it comes to ordering, it's a lot safer to ao by the previous year'ssales figures- if that's possible of course ... if we've sold the book before. We also build other factors into the equation including the type of course that the books are for, the students'year groupand a measure of our own judgement.", "And these criteria make a fairly accurate guide?", "As accurate as we can be, yes.", "What about the publishers? Do they take an active role in promoting new books?", "Certainly. The academic and professional publishing market is worth about £700 million a year, so publishers go to some lengths to make sure their books are known. The standard procedure they use is to mail outcataloguesto lecturers or colleges and universities, that's been the main form of promotion for years. Now, of course, they can also post details of new or revised works on websites. Some even go so far aswriting individual lettersto the appropriate lecturers in order to let them know what's coming up.", "The lecturers then contact you if they're interested ...", "That's right. The publishers send us - the book sellers - 'inspection copies'. Lecturers can then get a free copy and decide whether it's going to be suitable for their course.", "And how does it work with the students?

Over to you Rebecca.", "Rebecca: Thank you for inviting me. I remember when I graduated back in 1983, I was very excited about getting my first commission. My degree was in Fine Art and I'd worked long and hard to get it. I was an enthusiastic student and I never found it difficult to find the incentive to paint. I think as a student you're pushed along by fellow students and tutors and the driving force is there. However,when you leave college you find yourself saying things like 'I'll have one more cup of coffee and then I'll sit down to work'. I hate to admit it but I say it myself. Suddenly it isn't finding the inspiration or getting the right paper that's a problem, it's you.", "In my view, there are a number of reasons why this happens.It's a real challenge making a decent living as a new artist... you have to find a market for your work, often you work freelance and need to take samples or portfolios of your work from place to place ... these experiences are common to a lot of professional people ... but artists also have to bare their souls to the world in a way ... more than anything they want praise ...if people don't like what they create then it can be a very emotional and upsetting experience hearing them say this.", "I began to realise that these problems were preventing me from having a career in art and so I decided to experiment. I was a painter but I started to dabble in illustration ... drawing pictures for books, cards ... andthis offered me the opportunity to become more emotionally detached from my work. I was no longer producing images from the heart but developing images for a specified subject ... taking a more practical approach. I began to develop a collection of my illustrations which I put into a portfolio and started to carry around with me to show prospective clients and employers. But it was still tricky becausepublishers, for example, want to know that your drawings will reproduce well in a book, but without having had any work published, it's hard to prove this. Having a wonderful portfolio or collection of original artwork is, of course, a first step but what most potential clients would like to see is printed artwork and without this 'evidence'they tend to hold back still when it comes to offering a contract.", "Well, I overcame this problem in two ways. And I suppose this is my advice to you on preparing your portfolio of your best work. The first way was by submitting my work for acompetition, and the one I chose was for a horoscope design and was sponsored by a top women's magazine. There are a few of these competitions each year and they offer new illustrators an opportunity to showcase their work. The other approach I took was todesign and printsome mock-up pages of a book. In other words, I placed some of my illustrations next to some text in order to demonstrate how my work would look when it was printed.", "Perhaps I was lucky in that I had taken a degree that provided me with all-round creative skills so that I could vary mystyleand wasn't limited to a certaintechnique. I think that is important. The art world, and many other creative fields, do try to pigeon-hole people into snug boxes with an accompanying label. I think you should try to resist this if youfeel it happening to you. If you don't, you'll find it difficult to have new work accepted if you try to develop your style at a later stage in your career. Nevertheless, when you start out and particularly when you're going for an interview, it's important not to confuse people by having a lot of different examples in your portfolio. One remedy for this is to separate your work into distinctcategories. In my case, I did this by dividing my design-inspired illustrations from my paintings. It is then easier to analyse the market suited to each portfolio; such as magazines, book jackets, CD covers etc. Working undertwo namesis also useful as it clarifies the different approaches and offers a distinction between them.", "I think it's been hard for artists to be recognised in anything other than the pigeon-holes that they have been placed in.

And today we're taking a look at a number of different breeds of working dogs. And here to report on the dogs with jobs is Kevin Thornhill.", "Thanks, Joanne. Well yes, dogs with jobs is the subject of today's programme. Dogs have earned themselves a reputation over the centuries for being extremely loyal. And here's a little story which illustrates just howloyalthey are. Just outside the country town of Gundagai, is astatuebuilt to commemorate a dog - a dog which sat waiting for his owner to return to the spot where he'd left him. Well ... the story, which was immortalised in a song, has it that the poor dog died waiting for his master ‘five miles from GundegaiV, which is where they built the statue. Now that's what I call loyalty!", "Well, because of their loyalty and also their ability to learn practical skills dogs can be trained to do a number of very valuable jobs. Perhaps the most well known of working dogs is the border collie sheep dog. Sheep dogs which work in unison with their masters need to be smart and obedient with a natural ability to herd sheep. Some farmers say that their dogs are so smart that they not only herd sheep, they cancountthem, too!", "Another much-loved working dog is the guide dog, trained to work with the blind. Guide dogs, usually Labradors, need to be confident enough to lead their owner through traffic and crowds but they must also be of agentlenature. It costs a great deal of money to train a dog for this very valuable work but the Guide Dog Associations in the UK, America and Australia receive no government assistance so all the money comes fromdonations.", "Another common breed of work dog is the German shepherd. German shepherds make excellent guard dogs and are also very appropriate assearch and rescuedogs working in disaster zones after earthquakes and avalanches. These dogs must be tough and courageous to cope with the arduous conditions of their work. And so that they can be sent anywhere in the world to assist in disaster relief operations, effective dogs and their trainers are now listed on an internationaldatabase.", "When you arrive at an airport here in Australia, you may be greeted in the baggage hall by a detector dog, wearing a little red coat bearing the words 'Quarantine'. These dogs are trained to sniff out fresh fruit as well as meat and even live animals hidden in people's bags. In order to be effective, a good detector dog must have an enormous food drive - in other words they must reallylove their food. At Sydney airport where there are ten detector dogs working full time, they stop about80 peoplea month trying to bring illegal goods into the country. And according to their trainers, they very rarely get it wrong! Another famous working dog is the husky. Huskies, which originally came from Siberia, have been used for decades as a means of transport on snow, particularly in Antarctica where they have played an important role.

Linda is going to talk to us about the system of writing for the blind known as Braille. Linda, welcome.", "Thank you.", "Now we'd like to keep this session pretty informal, and I know Linda won't mind if members of the group want to ask questions as we go along. Let's start with an obvious one. What is Braille and where does it get its name from?", "Well, as you said, Braille is a system of writing used by and for people who cannot see. It gets its name from the man who invented it, the Frenchman Louis Braille who lived in the early 19th century.", "Was Louis Braille actually blind himself?", "Well ... he wasn't born blind, but he lost his sight at the age of three as the result of an accident in hisfather's workshop. Louis Braille then went to Paris to the National Institute for Blind Children and that's where he invented his writing system at the age of only 15 in1824while he was at the Institute.", "But he wasn't the first person to invent a system of touch reading for the blind, was he?", "No - another Frenchman had already come up with the idea of printing embossed letters that stood out from the paper but this was very cumbersome and inefficient.", "Did Louis Braille base his system on this first one?", "No, not really. When he first went to Paris he heard about a military system of writing using twelve dots. This was a system invented by an enterprising French army officer and it was known as 'night writing' It wasn't meant for the blind, but rather ... for battle communications at night.", "That must've been fun!", "Anyway, Braille took this system as a starting point but instead of using the twelve dots which 'night writing' used, he cut the number of dots in half and developed a six-dot system.", "Can you give us a little more information about how it works?", "Well, it's a system of touch reading which uses an arrangement of raised dots called a cell. Braille numberedthe dot positions 1-2-3 downward on the left and 4-5-6 downward on the right. The letters of the alphabet are then formed by using different combinations of these dots.", "So is the writing system based on the alphabet with each word being individually spelt out?", "Well ... it's not quite that simple, I'm afraid! For instance, the first 10 letters of the alphabet are formed using dots 1, 2, 4 and 5. But Braille also has its own short forms for common words. For example, 'b' for the word 'but' and 'h' for 'have' - there are many other contractions like this.", "So you spell out most words letter by letter, but you use short forms for common words.", "Yes. Though, I think that makes it sound a little easier than it actually is!", "And was it immediately accepted? I mean, did it catch on straight away?", "Well, yes and no! It was immediately accepted and used by Braille's fellow students at the school but the system was not officially adopted until 1854,two years after Braille's death. So, official acceptance was slow in coming!", "I suppose it works for all languages which use the roman alphabet?", "Yes, it does, with adaptations, of course.", "Can it be written by hand or do you need a machine to produce Braille?", "Well, you can write it by hand on to paper with a device called a slate and stylus but the trick is thatyou have to write backwards ... e.g. from right to leftso that then when you turn your sheet over, the dots face upwards and can be read like English from left to right.", "Student: Oh, I see.", "But these days you'd probably use a Braille­writing machine, which is a lot easier!", "And, tell us, Linda. Is Braille used in other ways? Other than for reading text?", "Yes, indeed. In addition to the literary Braille code, as it's known, which of course includes English and French, there are other codes. For instance, in 1965 they created a form of Braille forMathematics.", "I can’t, imagine trying to do maths in Braille!", "Yes, that does sound difficult, I agree. And there's also a version forscientific notation. Oh and yes, I almost forgot, there is now a version formusicnotation as well.", "Well, thanks, Linda."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the notes below.", "Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS or A NUMBER for each answer."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "21", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "father's workshop"}, {"question_number": "22", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "1824"}, {"question_number": "23", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "night writing"}]}, {"context": ["Choose the correct letter A, B or C."], "context_table": [], "type": "choice", "questions": [{"question_number": "24", "question_text": "Which diagram shows the Braille positions?ooooooooooooooooooooooooABC", "answer_options": ["A.

But when exactly do we start to remember things and how much can we recall?", "One of the first questions that we might ask is - do babies have any kind of episodic memory ... can they remember particularevents? Obviously, we can't ask them, so how do we find out?", "Well, one experiment that's been used has produced some interesting results. It's quite simple and involves a baby, in its cot, a colourful mobile and a piece ofstring. It works like this. If you suspend the mobile above the cot and connect the baby's foot to it with the string the mobile will move every time the baby kicks. Now you can allow time for the baby to learn what happens and enjoy the activity. Then you remove the mobile for a time and re-introduce it some time fromone to fourteen dayslater.", "If you look at this table of results ... at the top two rows ... you can see that what is observed shows that two- month-old babies can remember the trick for up to two days and three-month-old babies for up to afortnight.", "And although babies trained on one mobile will respond only if you use the familiar mobile, if you train them on a variety of colours and designs, they will happily respond to each one in turn.", "Now, looking at the third row on the table, you will see that when they learn to speak, babies as young as 21 months demonstrate an ability to remember events which happened several weeks earlier. And by the time they are two, some children's memories will stretch back oversix months, though their recall will be random, with little distinction between key events and trivial ones and very few of these memories, if any, will survive into later life. So we can conclude from this that even very tiny babies are capable of grasping and remembering a concept.", "So how is it that young infants can suddenly remember for a considerably longer period of time? Well, one theory accounting for all of this - and this relates to the next question we might ask - is that memory develops withlanguage. Very young children with limited vocabularies are not good at organising their thoughts. Though they may be capable of storing memories, do they have the ability toretrievethem? One expert has suggested an analogy with books on a library shelf. With infants, he says, 'it is as if early books are hard to find because they were acquired before the cataloguing system was developed'.", "But even older children forget far more quickly than adults do. In another experiment, several six-year-olds, nine-year- olds and adults were shown a staged incident. In other words, they all watched what they thought was a natural sequence of events. The incident went like this ... a lecture which they were listening to was suddenly interrupted by something accidentally overturning, in this case it was a slide projector. To add a third stage and make the recall more demanding, this 'accident' was then followed by anargument. In a memory test the following day, the adults and the nine-year-olds scored an average 70% and the six- year-olds did only slightly worse. In a retest five months later, the pattern was very different.The adults' memory recall hadn't changedbut the nine-year-olds' had slipped to less than 60% and the six-year-olds could manage little better than40%recall.", "In similar experiments with numbers, digit span is shown to..."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Write NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS and/ or A NUMBER for each answer", "Question:", "Can babies remember any  (31) ________?", "Experiment with babies:", "Apparatus:", "baby in cot", "colourful mobile", "some  (32) ________", "Re-introduce mobile between one and  (33) ________ later.", "Table showing memory test results", "Baby’s age", "Maximum memory span", "2 months", "2 days", "3 months", "(34) ________", "21 months", "several weeks", "2 years", "(35) ________"], "context_table": [["Baby’s age", "Maximum memory span"], ["2 months", "2 days"], ["3 months", "(34) ________"], ["21 months", "several weeks"], ["2 years", "(35) ________"]], "type": "table", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(particular) events"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "string(s)"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "14/fourteen days"}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(a) fortnight [OR] 2/two weeks"}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "null", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(over) six/6 months"}]}, {"context": ["Write NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS OR NUMBER for each answer", "Research questions:", "Is memory linked to  (36) ________ development?", "Can babies  (37) ________ their memories?", "Experiment with older children:", "Stages in incident:", "a) lecture taking place", "c)  (38) ________", "Age", "% remembered next day", "% remembered after 5 months", "Adults", "70%", "(39) ________", "9-year-olds", "70%", "Less than 60%", "6-year-olds", "Just under 70%", "better than  (40) ________"], "context_table": [["Research questions:   Is memory linked to   (36) ________  development?

I'd like to thank the Continuing Education Department for hosting this series of lectures on 'People behind the names you thought were fiction'. Welcome to this talk on 'The Grand Old Duke of York'.", "\nI'm sure you're all familiar with the old nursery", ": The Grand Old Duke of York. He had ten thousand men. He marched them up to the top of the hill. And he marched them down again, and so on. But did you know that the Duke of York immortalized in this popular", "was actually Frederick Augustus, second son of King George the Third of England and Queen Charlotte? He achieved fame in this way because of the humiliation he suffered at the hands of the French during the Revolutionary Wars at the end of the 18th century.", "\nFrederick was born on the 16th of August 1763 and from the age of seventeen he had been trained as a soldier. When war broke out between England and France in 1793, his father, the king, insisted that he should command the British contingent that was being dispatched to Flanders to co-operate with the Austrians and the Dutch. The Duke was a brave soldier, but, remember, he was only", "at the time; not only was he young but he was also inexperienced in battle and was unable to cope with the enthusiastic", "Revolutionary Army. He was let down by his allies too, and in spite of the arrival of ten thousand fresh troops from England, his campaigns were a disaster.", "\nHe was driven out of Dunkirk in September 1793, Flanders in May 1794, and Belgium in July 1794. Finally, during the winter of 1794 to 1795, his army retreated to the border of Hanover. And...with his unsuccessful campaigns over, the Duke returned to England. It was after this military fiasco that the Duke of York came to be(rather unkindly) satirized in song.", "\nWould you believe, despite all this, King George the Third arranged his son's", "to the position of Commander-in-Chief of the army in 17987 And, in the following year, he was appointed to command an army sent to invade Holland. Again he was unsuccessful and this confirmed the general opinion that he was not capable of commanding an army in the field.", "\nNevertheless, the rhyme is a bit cruel and harsh because it doesn't take into account the nature of the soldiers who served with Frederick. All the blame for lack of success should not have been attached to the Duke alone because the army he had under his command was made up from what is commonly described as 'the scum of the earth'—this is a somewhat offensive term used to refer to a group of people regarded as despicable and worthless. Who were they—these ordinary soldiers? Well they were mostly vicious, brutal", "or raw recruits and elderly men. The officers who commanded them were all untrained as military men. In fact, they were anybody who could afford to buy a commission.", "\nUm, but here's the really great thing that, unfortunately, the Duke of York is not remembered for: he realized that this was a hopeless kind of army and he set about improving conditions in order to recruit higher quality", ". He introduced padres—are you familiar with the term? No? Well, let me explain...you see, members of the British Armed Forces are generally Christians of one denomination or another, and a padre is a Christian cleric or chaplain who ministers to the soldiers and attends to their spiritual needs without belonging to any particular grouping within the Christian faith.", "\nNow, where was I? Yes, Frederick introduced padres, doctors and", "to the battlefield. Why", "? To attend to the horses, of course! Remember we're talking about late 18th century battlefields. He was also the founder of the Royal Military College for the training of", "at Sandhurst—yes, the very same one where the princes and other members of the royal family receive their military training today! Frederick also founded the Duke of York's School in London for sons of soldiers killed in battle. His name is perhaps better commemorated by this school in Chelsea than by the column that stands at the top of Waterloo Steps in St. James's Park.", "\nIn 1807, the Duke was involved in a", "with a woman and as a result resigned as Commander-in-Chief but he was reinstated in 1811 by his eider brother, the Prince Regent, who later became George the Fourth of England. He continued in this post until his death in 1827."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the sentences below.\nWriteNO MORE THAN ONE WORD OR A NUMBERfor each answer."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "Frederick was the name of the duke made famous in a well-known ______.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "RHYME/SONG"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "Frederick was aged ______ when he was sent to war.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "30/THIRTY"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "His battles against the ______ ended in total disaster.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "FRENCH"}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "In 1798, George Ⅲ gave his son a ______ within the ranks of the military.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "PROMOTION"}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "Frederick should not be held wholly accountable for failing: the ______ of his fighters made victory difficult to achieve.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "NATURE"}, {"question_number": "36", "question_text": "The people Frederick commanded were mostly old men, new conscripts or ______.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "(EX-)CONVICTS"}]}, {"context": ["WriteNO MORE THAN TWO WORDSfor each answer.\nThe Grand Old Duke of York:\n- wanted to enlist better types of____37____\n- made the army better by bringing in chaplains, medics and____38____\n- established a college for preparing army____39____\n- established school in Chelsea for sons of soldiers\n- gave up the position of Commander-in-Chief in 1807 because of a____40____\n- re-appointed later (in 1811) by his brother (George IV)\n- died in 1827"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "37", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "SOLDIERS"}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "VETS [OR] VETERINARY SURGEONS"}, {"question_number": "39", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "OFFICERS"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "SCANDAL"}]}]}]},

It's good to see so many of you taking an interest in meteorology. As you are all newcomers to the topic, let's keep it simple to start with. In fact, let's begin with a very simple definition of what meteorology is—the suffix '-ology' gives you a clue—at least you can all guess that it is 'the study of'...something. Meteorology is in fact the scientific study of all changes in the atmosphere—essential for forecasting the weather, of course. And you all know what weather is, right?

Beware the Cumulonimbus!

For this reason they are very", ".", "\nHydropower is also clean. It doesn't emit harmful gases that contribute to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. No trucks, trains or pipelines are needed to bring fuel to the site and there's no", "pollution either. Furthermore, hydropower plant machinery is fairly simple and runs at slow speeds, which makes it", "and durable. And, hydropower units are flexible also—they have the ability to start quickly and adjust rapidly to changes in demand for electricity, thus enabling them to meet peak loads. But this also allows them to serve as reserve capacity and bring more", "to the power system overall.", "\nThe dams that provide hydroelectric power also have other uses such as navigation, flood damage reduction, water supply, recreation, irrigation and low flow augmentation but it's not the purpose of this talk to go into those details.", "\nHow do the hydropower plants work? Well, a dam is built across a river which captures water to form a reservoir and raises the water level to create 'head'. Think of 'head' as the vertical distance that the water falls as it passes through the dam, in other words, the difference in water level between the reservoir behind the dam and the river below. Water from the reservoir flows through an", "into a penstock—this is kind of a narrow channel which leads to the turbine below. The force of the water causes the turbine to rotate rapidly which, in turn, drives the", "to spin and produce electricity. The electricity is carried the long distances from the powerhouse to substations on the outskirts of cities via", ".", "\nCan you build a hydropower unit on any river? Well, no, just having water in a river isn't enough. A good dam site must have enough stream flow as well as enough head. A fast flowing river on the plains is probably not suitable because a dam couldn't be built high enough to provide the head needed for efficient production of electricity. On the other hand, dams in arid high country may have plenty of head but insufficient stream flow. The perfect spot for a hydropower plant is where the right combination of", "and head exists.", "\nWhat about the environment? Surely the construction of large dams has an environmental impact? Well, yes it does. Certainly dams and reservoirs are built to improve the lives of people living in towns, farming communities and cities. But there must be a balance between development and preserving the natural environment. Needless to say, the natural river environment is changed which leads to changes in river ecology and aquatic habitat. Sometimes, for example, dissolved oxygen levels below darns get so low in summer that there is a negative impact on aquatic life. These levels can be improved, however, by using special aerating turbines and/or injecting oxygen directly into the stream flow. In order to protect and improve the habitat for endangered and other species of birds, fish and water life, there needs to be a thorough review of operating plans to see if a better balance can be achieved.", "\nHydropower plant design and operation must not only meet the needs of", "for electricity but work hand-in-hand with agencies whose concern is for the fish and wildlife, water quality and water supply."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the notes below.\nWriteONE WORD ONLYfor each answer.", "Hydropower\n● Renewable—constant source of____31____from natural hydrologic cycle\n●____32____—90% of hydro energy→electricity\n● Clean—no air or____33____pollution\n●____34____& durable—simple to operate\n● Flexible—can start & adapt quickly to meet demand→leads to____35____of power supply"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "WATER"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "EFFICIENT"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "NOISE"}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "RELIABLE"}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "STABILITY"}]}, {"context": ["Label the diagram below.\nWrite no more thanTWO WORDSfor each answer."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "36", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "INTAKE (GATE)"}, {"question_number": "37", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "GENERATOR"}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "POWER LINES"}]}, {"context": ["Complete the sentences below.\nWriteNO MORE THAN TWO WORDSfor each answer."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "39", "question_text": "To be effective, hydroelectric dams should be built across rivers with both sufficient head and ______.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "STREAM FLOW"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "There needs to be a balance between the needs of ______ living in developed environments and the preservation of natural habitat.", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "CONSUMERS/PEOPLE"}]}]}]},

A correct antibody (for that disease) clings to a particular", "in order to render it harmless. Large numbers of these pairs clump together to form a bigger unit. This is called agglutination and is able to be seen by the naked eye which is very helpful for doctors and other specialists to determine which illnesses a patient is immune to.", "\nInoculation, or active vaccination, can protect people from serious diseases. The vaccine may make a person feel unwell for a few days when the immune system starts to produce antibodies to match the introduced antigen. This is called a primary reaction. If that particular antigen should ever enter the body again later, a secondary reaction takes place.

Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support.", "This led to a number of problems. Firstly, there was more competition for food, which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger. As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park, some elephants began looking further afield. Elephants were routinely Q31 knocking down fences around the park, which then had to be repaired at a significant cost.", "To solve this problem, the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from Majete National Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park, where there were no elephants. But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge.So how did this translocation process work in practice?", "Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty, all belonging to one family. Q32 Because relationships are very important to elephants, they all had to be moved at the same time. Ateam of vets and park rangers flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group. Q33 which were rounded up and directed to a designated open plain.", "The vets then used darts to immobilise the elephants — this was a tricky manoeuvre, as they not only had to select the right dose of tranquiliser for different-sized elephants but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around. This also had to be done as quickly as Q34 possible so as to minimise the stress caused. As soon as the elephants began to flop onto the ground, the team moved in to take care of them.", "To avoid the risk of suffocation, the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying Q35 on their chests because their lungs could be crushed in this position. So all the elephants had to be placed on their sides. One person stayed with each elephant while they waited for the vets to do checks. It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing —if there were Q36 fewer than six breaths per minute, the elephant would need urgent medical attention. Collars were fitted to the matriarch in each group so their movements could be tracked in their new home. Measurements were taken of each elephant’s tusks — elephants with large tusks would Q37 be at greater risk from poachers — and also of their feet. The elephants were then taken to a recovery area before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home.", "The elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success — andnot just for the elephants.

With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres, there’s plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow. Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota’s damaged ecosystem and providing a sustainable conservation model, which could be replicated in other parks.

This is a type of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work. It was first developed for use in anthropology, and it’s also been used in sociology and communication studies. So what’s it got to do with business, you may ask. Well, businesses are finding that", ". And ethnography can also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want.", "Let’s look at some examples of how ethnographic research works in business. One team of researchers did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment. They watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and flour. They saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents, because", ". So a new design of cup was developed to overcome this problem, and it was a top seller.", "Another team of ethnographic researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa. They found that people who didn’t have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs. Because these customers paid in advance for their calls,", ". So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.", "Ethnographic research has also been carried out in computer companies. In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks. It was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that", "In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals.", ". This led to the development of a portable computer tablet that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.", "Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can’t be present. For example, in one project done for an airline,", "———————", "So what makes studies like these different from ordinary research? Let’s look at some of the general principles behind ethnographic research in business. First of all, the researcher has to be completely open-minded – he or she hasn’t thought up a hypothesis to be tested, as is the case in other types of research. Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them. As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that’s not really all that different from ordinary research – the criteria according to which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into,", ", or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example. But it’s absolutely crucial to recruit the right people as participants. As well as the criteria I’ve mentioned,", ". Actually, most researchers say that people open up pretty easily, maybe because they’re often in their own home of workplace.", "So what makes this type of research special is that it’s not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants, instead", ". But that doesn’t mean that the researcher never talks to the participants. However, unlike in traditional research, in this case it’s the participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow. This means that there’s less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the participant.", "But after they’ve said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office, the researchers’ work isn’t finished.", ". The researchers may end up with hundreds of pages of notes. And to determine what’s significant, they don’t focus on the sensational things or the unusual things, instead they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data, and to discern the meaning behind it. This can result in some compelling insights that can in turn feed back to the whole design process."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["Complete the notes below.", "Write ONE WORD ONLY for each answer.", "Ethnography: research which explores human cultures", "It can be used in business:", "● to investigate customer needs and 31…………….", "● to help companies develop new designs", "Examples of ethnographic research in business", "Kitchen equipment", "● Researchers found that cooks could not easily see the 32…………….. in measuring cups.", "Cell phones", "● In Uganda, customers paid to use the cell phones of entrepreneurs.", "● These customers wanted to check the 33…………….. used.", "Computer companies", "● There was a need to develop 34………………. to improve communication between system administrators and colleagues.", "Hospitals", "● Nurses needed to access information about 35…………….. in different parts of the hospital.", "Airlines", "● Respondents recorded information about their 36…………….. while travelling.", "Principles of ethnographic research in business", "● The researcher does not start off with a hypothesis.", "● Participants may be selected by criteria such as age, 37………………. or product used.", "● The participants must feel 38……………… about taking part in the research.", "● There is usually direct 39………………. of the participants.", "● The interview is guided by the participant.", "● A lot of time is needed for the 40……………… of the data.", "● Researchers look for a meaningful pattern in the data."], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "31", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "ATTITUDE/ATTITUDES"}, {"question_number": "32", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "NUMBERS"}, {"question_number": "33", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}, {"question_number": "34", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}, {"question_number": "35", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "PATIENTS"}, {"question_number": "36", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "EMOTIONS/FEELINGS"}, {"question_number": "37", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}, {"question_number": "38", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}, {"question_number": "39", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": "OBSERVATION"}, {"question_number": "40", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}]}]}]},

This is a very common tree here in Australia, where it’s also sometimes called the gum tree. First I’m going to talk about why it’s important, then I’m going to describe some problems it faces at present.", "Right, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives", "to creatures like birds and bats, and these and other species also depend on it for food, particularly the nectar from its flowers. So it supports biodiversity. It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from", "extracted from eucalyptus leaves.", "The eucalyptus grows all over Australia and the trees can live for up to four hundred years. So it’s alarming that all across the country, numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely. So what are the reasons for this?", "One possible reason is disease. As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows. The trees’ leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of", ". The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby. What is was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.", "But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees. By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia’s East Coast, of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back. The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners. Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected. What happens is that", "settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it. The bell-miner birds really like this solution, and in order to get as much as possible, they keep away other creatures that might try to get it. So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.", "————————–", "But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Die-back. So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation. One possibility is that it’s to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 years ago be ecologist William Jackson is that the", "of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there. If there are very frequent bushfires in a region, this encourages", "to grow afterwards, while if the bushfires are rather less frequent, this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.", "So why is this? Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus? Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume", "needed by eucalyptus trees. And there’s another reason. If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the eucalyptus in another way, by affecting the composition of the", ", and removing nutrients from it. So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive as long as they are not too frequent. In fact there’s evidence that Australia’s indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.", "But since Europeans arrived on the continent, the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels had led to what’s known as ‘", "rainforest’, which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions. And what’s special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a", "one. It has very thick, dense vegetation, but not much variety of species.

But actually these aren’t a lot of use. What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads – well, that’s not really very surprising. But there’s quite a lot going on that these maps don’t show, because they can’t capture the complex way that sound varies over time. So", ", and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer.

And there are other problems as well, for instance", "Now, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn’t differentiate between different types of noise.", ". That’s not necessarily something that we’d want to control or reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design.

Some recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradictory –", ".

You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it’s not used much for domestic purposes now because it’s highly toxic.", "But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment’s increasing. The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity. The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal, and when it’s burned it releases mercury into the atmosphere. Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it’s ingested by a fish it’s not excreted, it stays in the fish’s body and it enters the food chain. So it’s been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected, but", ".", "So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds.", "And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning, she’s looking for more subtle sub-effects.

About 20 years ago biologists developed the idea of what they called ‘biodiversity hotspots’. These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so one example is Madagascar.", ". Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily, but until recently, very little was known about species distribution and diversity in the oceans, and no one even knew if hotspots existed there.", "Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry.

And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots, and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the plankton that some of these species feed on.", "So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible. For example, there’s an international project called the Census of Marine Life. They’ve been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic.", "– sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick. Some of these species had never been seen before.

So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating a list of endangered species on land, so they consider things like the size of the population – how many members of one species there are in a particular place – and then they look at their distribution in geographical terms, although this is quite difficult when you’re looking at fish, because they’re so mobile, and then", "So far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to 20,000.", ".

Firstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans, places where marine species are protected. We have some, but not enough. In addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles, which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for migration, so they can get from one area to another safely. As well as this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas to prevent overfishing of endangered species. And finally, there’s the problem of ‘by-catch’. This prefers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats – they’re returned to the sea, but they’re often dead or dying.

Do the other students talk too much?", "Spiros: It’s partly that, but it’s mostly because I have had no confidence to speak out. Their style of speaking is so different – it’s not the style we were used to during the course. They use so many colloquialisms, they’re not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion.", ".", "Hiroko: You’re right, Spiros, I’ve experienced that too.", "Hiroko: For most of this semester, I’ve said absolutely nothing in tutorials.", ", and I’ve noticed an interesting thing, I’ve noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new, then the next time they actually asked for my opinion, and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion.", "Spiros: That’s great, Hiroko! I hope that happens for me next semester – I’ll have to work hard to find some interesting points.

Also, in class, we regularly had speed-reading tasks to do, and we kept a record of our reading speed, so the teachers were encouraging us to work on that.", "Hiroko: That’s true Spiros, but what we read could have been different.

First of all, I want to say thank you for your patience for the last six months. As you know, all the office staff had to move to temporary offices while the renovation work at the factory complex was taking place. But finally, that work is finished and everyone can return to the factory complex and their new office space. We're hoping everything will go smoothly, but there's a couple of things we'll need you to do during your first week back. You'll be pleased to know that your files and folders have been placed at your desk, so there's no need for you to go hunting around for any records.", "A couple of people have asked whether their old pass will still work at the security gate, or will they need to get their photo done and update their personal details. I can assure you that the old pass will still get you through the gate. No problem. Once you've had a chance to settle into the new offices, please take the time to view a training video for the operating system we're now using. We think it's going to manage all our programs far more efficiently. Obviously, the sooner you can get this done, the better.", "Also for next week, because the renovations have meant a complete redesign of some of the company's buildings, you'll need to attend a session on things like what to do if you hear the fire alarm go off and where to meet if you have to evacuate the buildings, we'll let you know as soon as we have a definite time for that. It's going to be a busy week for everyone, but hopefully the kind of challenge that can help bring the team together. We'll make a time for you to report back to me on Friday.", "All right. We've also taken some steps to improve the physical environment in your offices. Bigger windows mean that the offices are a lot brighter and that's better for your eyes.Inside we’ve replaced some dividing walls with colored glass panels. They look great. We've also invested in some adjustable chairs you can lower or raise them to whatever height feels right for you. What else? We've now got some quality insulationin the ceilings and walls that'll make everything a lot warmer. Also another thing, we've set aside several rooms for project work that will allow a team to get together around the same table. We feel that more opportunities for face to face discussion will benefit the whole company. So when you have had time….", "[pause]", "Okay, so let's look at a plan of the factory complex and see how it's changed. You can see that the main entrance is at the top of the map.EllerslieRoad is on the left hand side and the warehouse is at the bottom. Okay, let's start with one of the new buildings, the conference center. Perhaps if you look at the lower half of your plan on the right, there are two long buildings that are parallel to each other. The conference center is the one with a view of the river. Hopefully that is something visitors to the factory complex will appreciate, especially on a sunny day when it's clear outside. Now, what about the new office space? As you know, the officers used to be in that large building right alongside EllerslieRoad, and that could get a bit noisy at times. So what we've done is move the office space further away from the road into the building that directly joins on to reception. This should mean employees can benefit from a quieter working environment as well as the other improvements I mentioned earlier. We also decided to move the Stores building so it could be a lot closer to the warehouse.", "So now if you were going to enter the factory complex from the EllerslieRoad entrance, Stores would be the building immediately on your left. The Warehouse staff have already commented that having the stores here is much more convenient. Yes, I'm sure it's going to save a lot of time. Finance was another building that had to be relocated. They just didn't have enough space before, so you can see the main entrance on the plan, right? And below that is the roundabout. Then there's the road that goes from the roundabout directly to reception. Well, the finance building is about halfway along that road. On the plan, the factory is just above it. The Cafe, just so you know, is in the same place as before. It's not ideally located for the factory workers. That's true. But it's not too far if you're heading down from reception or up from the warehouse. But what we've done is try to make the environment a bit more pleasant. So whereas before you look straight from the cafe onto the large car park, now there's a line of trees separating them. I think you'll agree that this was a good decision, putting in the trees. I mean, it was also necessary to relocate the IT Department. Of course, for some of their work, they can do it remotely, but from time to time, the IT people do need to visit the different buildings around the factory complex. For that reason, we've given the IT Department a more central location. It's that square building you see right in the center of the plan, one of the closest buildings to the larger car park.

That researcher in the US, Joseph Goldberger, he realized people who basically lived off corn, were getting ill because they weren't eating anything else.", "Sam: Exactly. And other researchers were realizing the same thing. Like in places where people only ate white rice, they were suffering from a disease called Berry Berry.", "Lucy: So the researchers concluded that there must be something missing, that they stuff some people were eating had no nutritional value, and from there, researchers began to identify vitamins like A and B for the first time", "Sam: A huge scientific breakthrough.", "Lucy: So doctors, the public, everyone got to hear about vitamins. First, that they existed. And second, you needed them to be healthy.", "Sam: But it was governments that were really worried about vitamin deficiency. Certainly in the US and in the UK, at least.", "Lucy: What do you mean?", "Sam: Well, in the 1930s, those governments were worried about people's general health because everyone was suddenly buying canned fruit, artificial butter meat in tins, that kind of thing. It became very common. And so newspapers were featuring lots of government reports about how serious this was.", "Lucy: I see.", "Sam: And then some people saw a business opportunity.", "Lucy: Naturally", "Sam: In the 1940s, companies started making and selling vitamin supplements in bottles, and they decided the easiest way to market them was to target housewives.", "Lucy: Why was that? Because housewives were responsible for keeping families healthy?", "Sam: I'd say so. In the weekly magazine's, Housewives read, the companies made exaggerated claims about what the supplements could do. And they showed pictures of rats in a laboratory before and after they were given vitamins. The before pictures showed the rats looking very sick.", "Lucy: So they scared the housewives into buying their product?", "Sam: Apparently.", "Lucy: But vitamins were still expensive, weren't they? It wasn't until the 1950s that more people could afford to buy them.", "Sam: Why was that?", "Lucy: Well, manufacturers had discovered how to produce vitamins artificially and in enormous quantities in their factories.", "Sam: I suppose that's what goes on with any product. It starts expensive until manufacturers adapt their technology. Were there any developments in the 1960s?", "Lucy: Companies changed their promotional strategy to increase their sales. They used movie stars to say how effective the supplements were.", "Sam: That's still true today. Celebrity endorsement really seems to work. Someone on the TV says vitamins have made them healthier, and immediately more consumers go out and buy them.", "[pause]", "Lucy: So apparently the number of Australians taking vitamin supplements has doubled in the last decade.", "Sam: Incredible. I suppose so many fitness related articles recommend them.", "Lucy: I wouldn't say that that's the reason. According to the research I read, many Australians are just taking a more active approach to staying well. They don't want to rely on their doctor for everything, so they're turning to vitamins. They can take those themselves and feel they're doing something positive. So it doesn't have anything to do with the fact the price is dropped because so many companies are making supplements.", "Sam: I doubt it. Even people in lower socioeconomic groups are buying them apparently", "Lucy: Most of my own research has been about the US vitamin supplement industry. Did you know the industry is under no obligation to prove that their supplements actually work? I don't think that's right.", "Sam: How do you mean?", "Lucy: Well, in the US, the Food and Drug Administration Department regards vitamin supplements as a food with medicine. Manufacturers have to demonstrate that their products really can improve people's health before they go on sale.", "Sam: But you said vitamins are classed as a food.", "Lucy: Yes. So the industry can sell whatever vitamin supplements they like. You know, this one will improve your brain function, even if there's nothing to support their claims", "Sam: That Danish experiment thousands of people took part in that.", "Lucy: Yes. The scientists wanted to see if high doses of vitamins really could prevent medical problems like heart disease or just reduce the chances of people getting a simple cold.", "Sam: But the high dose people were just as likely to get sick as the people not taking any vitamins. That's not to say that scientists now know everything about vitamins.", "Lucy: No, like you say, investigations and long term trials need to continue before they can be certain about what taking vitamin supplements can actually achieve.", "Sam: But in the meantime, do we need stricter regulation of the supplement industry? Do you think people would stop buying and taking vitamins if they were told it's a waste of time?", "Lucy: Hardly. No one likes being told what they can or can't buy, especially where health is concerned.", "Sam: Fair enough.

In other words, the reasons why some insect populations are declining and might even become extinct in the 21st century. I'll also talk about the consequences if extinction occurs and some possible ways to prevent that.", "Let's start with the reasons. First of all, when we look at what's going on in Europe, we can see a huge decline in certain species of insect. This is partly because farmers no longer allow certain plants to grow in their fields. But farmers are not entirely to blame. The gardens that people have nowadays don't always contain the kind of plant that insects need. So perhaps we need to rethink what we're putting there. In more tropical regions of the world, for example, the Amazon rainforest, scientists have noticed that the number of beetle and butterfly species also appears to be diminishing. They put this down to climate change rather than, say, the fragmentation of habitat. But more research has to be done. And then, there's the use of pesticides, and of course, this happens everywhere in the world. Pesticide is designed to kill a range of insects that farmers don't like. But it also kills bees, which they need. Pesticide might not kill bees directly, but we know that it impacts on their spatial skills, meaning they cannot make sense of what they see around them and also their memory. This means that they cannot remember how to get back to their hive.", "So why worry about whether insects become extinct? Well, the consequences would obviously be terrible, not just for them, but for us. Pretty much everywhere on the planet. With the exception of Antarctica, insects are at the bottom of the food chain. They're absolutely vital, because if there were no insects, there would also be no birds or lizards or mammals. Then there's the role that insects play in crop production. We use them to pollinate our fruit and vegetables, and it would be impossible to manage without them. It's also worth remembering that scientists are now studying plants to find out whether they might be a source of medicine in the future. If these plants disappear because of insect extinction, that would be another lost opportunity.", "So there's some possible ways we could prevent insect extinction, some more controversial than others. I think it's a given that governments have to do something about the sale of pesticides. In fact, some countries have already passed laws to ban certain products. That's a good move forward. But ordinary people can also make a difference if we cut down on how much meat we ate, some of the land now used for grazing could be turned back into insect friendly environments. I'd like to finish with a positive story. There's a place in California called the Antioch Dunes. In the 1900s, people looked at the dunes and the sands that formed them and thought that sound is a great raw material. And because they needed to build houses, they removed tons and tons of the sand and turned it into bricks. It wasn't really until the 1960s that biologists suddenly realized that the Antioch Dunes that’d actually been home to some unique species of plant and insect. But by this time, there was only one species of butterfly left, the metal mark butterfly. And a major problem for the metal mark was that it required a certain plant to survive something called the naked stem buckwheat. It was on this plant that it laid its eggs. So, yes, you can see why the buckwheat was important. Well, in the end, the only way that the biologists could get the buckwheat to start growing properly was to replace the sand. That was a great first step. But the metal mark butterfly is still endangered. In the last decade, a significant number of butterflies and plants have been destroyed in the Antioch Dunes by fire. So now the biologists are limiting the number of visitors who can wander around the dunes. That's fair enough, I think. All right. The final point I want to make about the project to restore the Antioch Dunes area is to do with how much land is required.

Can I help you?", "Woman:", "I hope so! I have a friend in Spain and her two daughters are coming to the city to study for a month. So I thought the Tourist Information Centre was the best place to ask about hostels. Can you recommend any?", "Man:", "Of course. Ah, I usually suggest one of the Hostelling International places. HI West End is a big hostel in a residential area, but it's only ten minutes from downtown if you take a bus. It's really popular.", "Woman:", "OK. Sounds good! I need to know how much it costs. The girls want a double room to themselves. They don't want to share with other people.", "Man:", "That makes it more expensive. The price is under $30 for a bed in a dormitory but they'll be paying $50 a night. But if they become members of Hostelling International, the price comes down to $41 a night. Membership costs $35.", "Woman:", "Right.", "Man:", "And membership offers them benefits too on all kinds of activities.", "Woman:", "Ah, what kind of things?", "Man:", "Oh, er, skydiving and white-water rafting. Things like that.", "Woman:", "Mm, I don't think they're interested in that kind of thing. If they become members, will they get cheaper entrance tickets to museums?", "Man:", "Oh, yes and also discounts on bicycle and car hire.", "Woman:", "OK. It's probably worth it. Is the hostel very noisy? They're coming here to do some studying.", "Man:", "Ah, I think it is quite noisy as it's a really big hostel. And if they want to use the Internet this hostel still makes a charge unfortunately. It's $1 for 15 minutes and $3 for an hour.", "Woman:", "Mm … it might not be ideal for them.

It is possible to buy meals in the hostel at a reasonable price but because it isn't very busy in the winter, they only cook in summer.", "Woman:", "Oh, I think I know the place you mean. It's an old building, isn't it?", "Man:", "Yes, it's well known as it's one of the oldest in the city. There's been a hotel there since 1887 when it was first built. It was turned into a hostel in 1985 and they've invested a lot of money restoring it inside.", "Woman:", "Mm, they'd like that but I'm just looking on the map at where their college is – it's right in the centre. It is a bit far for them from there.", "Man:", "The hostel actually has scooters for hire at a very good price. So they could do that. Er, it would be quicker than cycling or walking to the centre.", "Woman:", "Mm, it is a bit expensive … But it sounds like the best one so far unless there's something a bit cheaper?", "Man:", "OK. Er, well, what about the Backpackers Hostel? That's not so expensive. It's in a side street in the entertainment district. They wouldn't need to go far to find everything they want – they could walk everywhere. And it's very reasonable. Only $45 and another $5 if they want to have breakfast.", "Woman:", "Mm, but what about other meals?", "Man:", "There's no café but on each floor in this hostel there's a kitchen for residents to cook in. I'm not sure how well equipped they are but it should be fine for basic meals.", "Woman:", "Well, that's really very helpful.

I don’t think you were very clear about species already there.", "Lee:", "Um, according to what I’ve read, there were some crab apples, but that was all. Everything that people now think of as traditional American apples, were species that the Europeans either introduced or bred by chance.", "Anita:", "Because they tended to sow seeds rather than use grafting.", "Tutor:", "Yes, quite. But what to me was fascinating – and I saw most members of your audience start to take notes – was when you discussed how the apple genes spread via the Silk Route into Europe from the wild apple woods of Kazakhstan.", "Lee:", "Yes, well. I'd like to have said more about the development of grafting in ancient China, as a way of producing predictable varieties. It was so early in history!", "Tutor:", "But it's the natural development of the original wild apple into new species that people wanted more about. Which says a lot for your presentation. You enthused your audience!", "Tutor:", "So, now we need to discuss the form your follow–up work will take. Are you going to produce a paper? Or are you thinking of putting it all up on the department website?", "Anita:", "Um, I felt we could do both. And we could do a poster of some of the data. But Lee wasn’t sure.", "Lee:", "No. I think it would be enough to use the website.We can offer a link to our email for queries. That would save time and trees!", "Tutor:", "I think Lee's right. A poster would be nice, but it'd take too much time.", "Anita:", "OK.", "Tutor:", "Now I just want to give you a few pointers about the techniques of your presentation.

The green colour of some cans was altered by the addition of yellow, so they were a brighter green.", "Then test subjects were asked what they thought about the flavour of the drink in the new-style cans, and they stated that there was more lime in the drink if it was in the ones with the new colour.", "This was because the brain picks up cues from the way the product is presented, as well as the product itself, which trigger taste sensations. Before food was packaged, humans used colour to gauge the ripeness of fruit, for example.", "Next there's the old problem with chewing gum. Everyone knows that after a few minutes’ chewing it loses its minty flavour. However, if you ask people to chew up to the point where it becomes tasteless, and then ask them to eat a little sugar and continue chewing, to most people's surprise, what happens is that the original mintiness actually returns because it is the sweetness which is needed to make the mintiness perceptible.", "So combinations of flavours can be significant, as the brain needs one of them in order to recognise the other. Another experiment demonstrates something we’ve all done.", "Drink half a fizzy drink straight from the fridge and then leave it at room temperature for a while. Take a sip and you may well decide you don't like it. The warm drink is too sweet to be refreshing.", "So put the rest back in the fridge until it’s chilled again. Now try it. Much better. Of course the sweetness doesn't change, it is our perception, because how sweet it tastes depends on the temperature. The extent to which the drink is sweetened is less evident if the drink has been cooled.", "Another interesting result has been derived from experiments with sound. One of these involved eating crisps. Subjects were put into soundproof rooms and given batches of crisps to eat.", "As they ate, the sound of crunching which they made as they ate the crisps was played back to them. This was adjusted so that they sometimes heard the crunching as louder, or, at other times, more high–frequency sounds were audible in the sound feedback that accompanied their eating.", "Fascinatingly, if the sound level was louder or higher frequency they reported that the crisps were actually fresher. Of course, the crisps were in fact the same every time! So, it was clear that the level and quality of what they were hearing was influencing their taste perceptions.", "So, we've looked briefly at colour, at complementary flavours, at temperature and sound. It seems that all the senses are working together here, but what about the sense of touch? A number of experiments have been done in this area.", "If you take, for instance, cheese sauce and prepare different versions, some thicker and some thinner, but without any alteration in the strength of flavour, what do you think the subjects perceive? Yup, if the sauce is thicker, they'll say the cheesy flavour is less strong.", "It was clear that the thing that was influencing the subjects' judgement about the flavour of the sauces was the texture of each one. Now, this result is important for dietitians as well as marketing executives.", "Lastly, another variation on the two flavours theme. This concerns the capacity of the brain for bridging a sensory gap. The subjects in this experiment stuck out their tongues so that the testers could drip two liquids onto them simultaneously, one strawberry flavoured and one sugar flavoured.", "The testers then took away each flavour in turn.

I’ve been looking at some on the web and I think that a garden on top of a building is the up-and-coming thing.", "Tutor:", "OK. So you’ve done a bit of reading already? What benefits would there be for the client? Why do you think a supermarket chain would be willing to meet the expense of construction? You do realize that would be the first thing they raise.", "Student:", "Yes, I know. But I’d explain that in spite of the initially high expense, they would save that much in approximately five years. Well, I’d have to do sums, I mean calculate specifically…", "Tutor:", "Yes, how would the saving come about?", "Student:", "Mainly through lower heating and aircon bills. The extra insulation offered by having a layer of living plants in the soil would make a huge difference.", "Tutor:", "OK. But they might feel the expense of maintenance would be an issue. After all, supermarkets don’t normally employ gardeners.", "Student:", "What I thought was, if they made it a community garden rather than a simple low-maintenance green roof….", "Tutor:", "So there’d be public access?", "Student:", "Oh yes! Then there’d be a sense of ownership in the local community and people could take responsibility for it, instead of the supermarket paying a commercial company, and It’d really boost their public relations.", "Tutor:", "That’s a good point. And have you been looking into how rook gardens are built nowadays?", "Student:", "I’m still exploring that, but if take advantage of the latest technologies for roof gardens, it shouldn’t be too difficult. But in any case, you have to use lightweight materials.", "Tutor:", "But that’s a matter of making the right choices. You can even use quite traditional ones such as wood for the planting areas.", "Student:", "Yes, that’s what I thought. It’ll look good and it isn’t too heavy.", "Tutor:", "But the basic construction, the issue you have to address first is the material used between the building and the garden.", "Student:", "You mean the barrier fabric, which ensures there’s no chance of rainwater leaking down into the building?", "Tutor:", "Yes, nowadays that is very good, and quite easily sourced.", "Student:", "Then on the other hand, there’s the business of water within the roof garden itself.", "Tutor:", "You mean drainage? That’s an important feature of the construction in any roof design.", "Student:", "Yes, but I think most drainage issues have been well understood for quite a long time.", "Tutor:", "OK, but another thing is with plants in an exposed situation, you usually need to find ways to optimize rainfall.", "Student:", "Yes, because rainwater is best for the garden, if you can store it for when it’s needed. What I’ve been looking at are some buildings which use fairly conventional storage tanks, the kind that have been in use for decades, but have them linked to modern automatic watering systems.", "Tutor:", "Sounds complicated.", "Student:", "It’s less so in practice than it sounds, I think. I’ve been researching them and actually the latest ones definitely work very well and they can be electronically regulated to suit the local microclimate.", "Tutor:", "Mmm, that sounds interesting. You seem to have been doing some thorough research! Make sure you reference all your sources when you write it up.", "Student:", "Yes, sure. Um, there’s one more aspect I’d just like to run past you, if there’s time? I want to include a light feature in the design.", "Tutor:", "Of course.", "Student:", "I’ve got a sketch here.", "Tutor:", "Let’s have a look then.", "Student:", "Well, I was really impressed by something I saw on a roof in Cornwall and I’d like to design something similar. Um, you have an area of planting, and I'm thinking of installing this lighting in an area filled with low-growing evergreen shrubs.", "Tutor:", "Mmm. You’d have to have lights and things well away from anywhere children might be. How would it work? On this drawing, this is a section view? You have this low wall on the right?", "Student:", "Yes, that’s it. This is just one element and these areas would be repeated all round the planted area. I think this will probably be a wooden wall, using reclaimed timbers, with an angled ceramic top surface.", "Tutor:", "Perhaps even ridge tiles like they use on roofs?", "Student:", "Oh, yes, that’d be just the sort of thing. And that’d make it waterproof. Um and then the heavy duty electric wiring comes up through the floor just outside the planted area and into the wall. Then it’s brought through a projector low in the side of the wall, and that sends a beam of light along the fibre optic cable.", "Tutor:", "So there’s no electricity in the actual lights. It's in the actual lights. The fibre optic goes across the surface of the soil in the planting area.", "Student:", "Yes, that’s the beauty of it. The shrubs will soon grow to cover it up, of course, and then the cable goes past a wooden post which is between the shrubs, and can be a support for them as they grow bigger, and then runs up into each element of the installation.", "Tutor:", "So the light beam is carried up to the top of each element and illuminates a kind of conical glass cap? I see! Is that the bit which would glow in the dark?", "Student:", "Yes.", "Tutor:", "And what’s the cap supported on?

He started collecting sand in the 1980s, and he still collects it now, even though he has around a thousand samples.", "They come from his travels and from geologists and amateurs all over the world – and the collection includes sand from each continent, including Antarctica.", "People send him sand in envelopes, plastic bags, paper towels and all sorts!

When you get home, your samples should be logged in a notebook or computer.

You want to keep everything in good condition and avoid contamination. So first you make absolutely sure that each sample is perfectly dry.", "You don't need any complicated apparatus for this, you can just air it out on layers of newspaper, which is suitably absorbent. Most people find that's the best way.", "Then, lastly, but this is really important, before there can be any chance of confusing this latest sample with another, you put it in a clean small bag or a jar, and you must stick an identification label on straight away.", "Some people put one inside as well in case the outer label falls off, but that's up to you.

I’m going to tell you a little bit about the museum first and then show you around. As you can see, Brampton is an open–air museum. The first open-air museums were established in Scandinavia towards the end of the 19th century, and the concept soon spread throughout Europe and North America and there are several in Britain, all of which tell the history of a particular part of the country.", "Brampton focuses on life during the 19th century. The site was chosen because there were already some historic 19th-century buildings here and others have been dismantled in different parts of the region and rebuilt on the site. This hadn’t been attempted before in these parts so we’re very proud of what we have here. All the buildings are filled with furniture, machinery and objects. You may be able to see these in other museums but not in their original settings.", "What also sets Brampton apart from other museums is that the story of the exhibits is told not by labels but by costumed staff like myself. I look after sheep, cows and hens, which are much the same as those you see on modern farms, but I use traditional methods to care for them. You will also be able to see a blacksmith and a printer, as well as other craftspeople.", "If you talk to them, you’ll be able to find out what life was really like 150 years ago. Our programme of activities during the year has guided walks, an agricultural fair and all the other events you would expect a museum to have, but remember: here you experience them in the real surroundings.", "The site is divided into different areas. The main building contains our High Street which is a street of 19th-century shops, offices and some homes. There’s a stationer’s shop which sells a range of specially selected cards, prints and copies of Victorian stationery, all available for purchase by visitors.

But I think some of the lessons weren’t ones I wanted to share with the whole group. I mean, my expectations about what it would be like were too high. I’d been fantasising a bit about what I’d be doing. I mean, it all worked out OK in the end … but I got off to a bad start.", "Dr Erskine:", "Yes, I heard something similar from the producer – urn. Ainsley Webb – who assessed your performance. He was Quite negative about some of the things you did, and your initial attitude. I’m afraid. Would you like to give me your version?", "Cressida:", "I couldn’t prepare properly is the main thing.

First of all, did you eventually feel you were given enough to do?", "Cressida:", "The first couple of days were manic, the production team was short of staff and I was rushing all over the building taking messages to various people and fetching things. Of course, I didn’t know my way around, so I kept ending up in some storeroom or somewhere instead of the studio I was meant to be in. Or I mistook some important visitor for a colleague because I didn’t know who anyone was.", "Cressida:", "Then after that, things sort-of calmed down, so sometimes I was hanging about until someone decided to give me a chore. But I had a piece of luck at the end of the week because they got a new bit of equipment which was the same as we have in the editing suite here and I knew how to use it. which none of them did. So that gave me a bit of status.", "Cressida:", "Unfortunately, it meant I spent the next three days stuck in the editing suite. But by the end, I’d shown I wasn’t just a silly student, so then, when the senior reporter needed someone to go out with him when he went to interview a junior minister, I got to go along because he knew I could handle the technical side.", "Dr Erskine:", "Well, that’s good.", "Cressida:", "Yes. Well, I know I need to learn from my mistakes. I mean, basically I need to think more about forward planning, but on the other hand, I feel much more confident now; I did survive, I didn’t ruin anything, I did actually make a contribution, according to the producer. One thing I want to take forward to my final assignment, though, is some reflections on ethics.", "Dr Erskine:", "Yes?", "Cressida:", "I had a bit of an argument with one of the senior presenters. He was editing part of an interview and he just changed something someone said. When I questioned him he just snubbed me.

I’m going to look at the different stages the electric guitar went through before we ended up with the instrument we know so well today.", "The driving force behind the invention of the electric guitar was simply the search for a louder sound. In the late 1890s Orville Gibson, founder of the Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Manufacturing Company, designed a guitar with an arched or. curved lop, as is found on a violin. This made it both stronger and louder than earlier designs but it was still hard to hear amongst other louder instruments.", "During the 1920s with the beginnings of big–band music, commercial radio and the rise of the recording industry, the need to increase the volume of the guitar became even more important. Around 1925 John Dopyera came up with a solution. He designed a guitar, known as The National Guitar, with a metal body which had metal resonating cones built into the top. It produced a brash tone which became popular with guitarists who played blues but was unsuitable for many other types of music.", "Another way of Increasing the volume was thought of in the 1930s. The C. F. Martin Company became known for its ‘Dreadnought‘, a large flat-top acoustic guitar that used steel strings instead of the traditional gut ones. It was widely imitated by other makers.", "These mechanical fixes helped, but only up to a point. So guitarists began to look at the possibilities offered by the new field of electronic amplification. What guitar players needed was a way to separate the guitar’s sound and boost it in isolation from the rest of a band or the surroundings.", "Guitar makers and players began experimenting with electrical pickups which are the main means of amplification used today. The first successful one was invented in 1931 by George Beauchamp.", "He introduced to the market a guitar known as The Frying Pan’ because the playing area consisted of a small round disk. The guitar was hollow and was made of aluminium and steel. He amplified the sound by using a pair of horseshoe–shaped magnets. It was the first commercially successful electric guitar.", "So by the mid-1930s, an entirely new kind of sound was born. Yet along with its benefits, the new technology brought problems. The traditional hollow body of a guitar caused distortion and feedback when combined with electromagnetic pickups. Musicians and manufacturers realised that a new kind of guitar should be designed from scratch with amplification in mind.", "In 1935 Adolph Rickenbacker produced a guitar which took his name – ‘The Rickenbacker Electro Spanish’. It was the first guitar produced in plastic, which, because of its weight, vibrated less readily than wood. It eliminated the problems of earlier versions which were plagued by acoustic feedback.", "‘The Electro Spanish’ had its own problems, however, because it was very heavy, smaller than other guitars of the period, and was quite awkward to play. Developments continued and in 1941 Les Paul made a guitar which he called ‘The Log’, and true to its name, it was totally solid. All previous guitars had been hollow or partly hollow. It looked slightly strange but the next step had been made towards the modem electric guitar.", "The first guitar successfully produced in large numbers was made in 1950 by Leo Fender. His Spanish-style electric guitar, known as a ‘Fender Broadcaster’, had a bolt-on neck, and was initially criticised by competitors as being very simple and lacking in craftsmanship. Yet it was immediately successful and was particularly suited to mass production, spurring other guitar companies to follow Fender’s lead.", "In 1951 Leo Fender revolutionised the music world yet again when he produced an electric bass guitar. This was the first commercially successful bass model to be played like a guitar. It was easier for players to hit an exact note: that’s why it was called The Precision’.", "Although there had already been electric standup basses, this was much more portable. It is now standard in the line-up of any rock band and some historians suggest that entire genres of music, such as reggae and funk, could not exist without it.", "In 1952 the Gibson company became Fender’s first major competitor when Ted McCarty created The Gibson Les Paul’ guitar. It was distinctive because it was coloured gold. The reason for this was to disguise the fact that it was made from two different kinds of wood.", "In 1954 Leo Fender responded to this successful instrument by introducing The Fender Stratocaster’. It is easily identified by its double-cutaway design and three pickups. This model may be the most influential electric guitar ever produced.

There are five major road junctions around the edge of the city so we set up equipment to check the air quality on each of those three times on one day.", "Lauren:", "In the morning and evening, which is when most journeys are made in and out of the city, and at 2.30 in the afternoon.", "Stefan:", "On the same day. we went to the two busiest junctions in the morning and evening to calculate the traffic flow into the city.", "Tutor:", "Right.", "Stefan:", "We'll be able to produce some graphs from the figures we collected.", "Lauren:", "Yeah.", "Tutor:", "Presumably you then looked at where all these cars ended up?", "Lauren:", "l thought we should look at why people were coming into the city - um, whether it was for employment or education or leisure activities but Stefan thought that would be too difficult.", "Stefan:", "Because most people were in cars it would be hard to ask them. So we decided to spend an afternoon examining the parking facilities available instead.", "Stefan:", "We established the capacity of each car park and we spent an afternoon counting cars in and out so we have an idea of how long people spend in the city centre.", "Tutor:", "So do you have evidence that most journeys are made by car within the city centre?", "Stefan:", "We checked local government statistics to see if that was true but they were inconclusive.", "Lauren:", "Everything is quite close together in the city centre and there are wide pavements so you would expect people to walk from one place to another.", "Stefan:", "So we chose a number of locations and we noted how many pedestrians passed a particular spot.", "Tutor:", "Um, how did you choose where to do that?", "Stefan:", "Oh, we stood at two places in the business district, one in the shopping area and the other was in an area where there are more tourists.", "Tutor:", "Right.", "Lauren:", "I thought it was really important to talk to people so we carried out a survey on how people usually travelled into the city. We asked them about their usual means of transport.", "Stefan:", "We found out that it varied according to why people were travelling -if they were employed in the city they wanted to get there quickly but if they were coming in for their leisure time they didn't mind using the bus.", "...:", "Lauren: That's all we had time for while we were there.", "Tutor:", "OK. So shall we talk about what you're going to do next and how you're going to divide the tasks up? How are you going to present the data you've got?", "Stefan:", "Well, some of the information can be presented as graphs or maps.", "Lauren:", "I'm quite good at the software.", "Stefan:", "You'd better do that then, Lauren. I'll help you check all the statistics before you start.", "Lauren:", "OK.", "Tutor:", "Um, it's good to present as much as you can visually. Is there anything else you can use as visuals?", "Stefan:", "Mm ... we've got a lot of photographs which we can go through.", "Tutor:", "Aha.", "Lauren:", "Er, we both took them so some will be duplicated. It's going to take ages to go through them all. Maybe one of us should just choose some.", "Tutor:", "It's better if you collaborate. That way you'll end up with the best of what you've got.", "Lauren:", "That's fine. we'll do that.", "Tutor:", "And, er,when the graphs and maps are done, you'll need to write a report, an analysis of the data. Will you do that together?", "Stefan:", "I think that should be my responsibility if we're going to share the work out evenly. I can use some of Lauren's notes as well as my own.", "Tutor:", "OK. And finally, you'll be presenting your project to the rest of the group in a couple of weeks' time.", "Lauren:", "We thought it'd be better for Stefan to do that as he's got more experience at that kind of thing.", "Tutor:", "I would prefer to have input from both of you as I have to do an assessment.", "Stefan:", "We'll take turns then. We'll divide it into sections and talk about a few things each.", "Tutor:", "Good. You'll find it easier, Lauren, than doing a presentation on your own. Well, if you need to ask me any more questions while you're working on this, email me.

Before I talk in detail about the experiments and innovations of the British ceramicists, I'd like to give you a summary of the social and manufacturing background in which they lived and worked.", "So, we're talking about England, or more specifically, the region known as 'The Midlands', and we need to go back, mainly to the eighteenth century and, briefly, even earlier, to put it in a global context.", "Now, at that period the majority of the population, whatever their station in life, as you might say, were dependent for their living, in one way or another not on the geographical location of where they lived,but on the physical characteristics of the actual land they lived on.", "This is true, whether we're talking about the aristocracy, the owners of great estates, who incidentally had no snobbery about the concept of making money from all the reserves of coal, or timber, or stone on their rolling acres, or the farmers making a fat living from the rich soils.", "And besides these groups, and the less affluent ones, the deposits of iron ore and lead, the limestone and flint and the brown and yellow clays also sustained the numerous industries in the area.", "It's important to recognise that it was already an industrial region, and had been so for centuries. There were many Midland trades, some of them indigenous, some of them not.", "For example, there were immigrants from France who came as early as the late sixteenth century and they were producers of glass. A century later, there is plenty of evidence that the variety of trades was enormous: there was brewing in Burton-on-Trent; silk-weaving and ribbon-making near Coventry; framework knitting around Nottingham.", "And of course, in Cheshire men dug the salt, as we still do nowadays even which in that era was sent downriver to the estuary of the Mersey.", "Now, among these well-established trades, one of the oldest of the local crafts was pottery. As you will probably be aware, ceramics has always been a mix of science, design and skill, and a good potter is in a sense an experimental chemist, trying out new mixes and glazes, and needing to be alert to the impact of changes of temperature on different types of clay.", "For two hundred years, up to the time we are concerned with, potters had been making butter pots and pitchers and patterned plates, using the clay which was plentiful in the area where they lived -in a handful of North Staffordshire villages dotted along the low hills.", "Now I want to explain a little about the industrial processes which had preceded the great breakthrough in Germany in 1708. That's when the formula for porcelain was discovered, a secret that had been held in China for a thousand years.", "In the Midlands, in England, as elsewhere, there had basically been two kinds of pottery. The first was known, is still known, as 'earthenware'.", "Now this was a bit rough and ready, but it was deservedly popular for several reasons. To start with, it was relatively cheap, so it could be used by most households. This was because it could be made from local clay without any complicated processing or added materials.", "From the potter's point of view there was another reason for its cheapness. This was that it could be fired in simple ovens, or kilns, and at relatively low temperatures, so he didn't have to spend so much money on fuel to achieve the necessary heat.", "On the other hand, after one firing in the kiln, the problem with earthenware was that it remained porous so had limited usefulness. So for most purposes it had to go back in the kiln for a second firing before it became waterproof.", "And another thing was that it was extremely breakable -I mean, before it had even been sold. I suppose the potter wouldn't have minded so much if people just had to keep coming back for more every time they broke a jug or whatever! -but it was very inconvenient because it meant there was a lot of wastage in the course of the manufacturing process.", "Anyway, for all these reasons, if people could afford it, and that would be all but the very poor, they would buy stoneware,a much tougher product.", "Now, for this, the potter used a slightly more expensive raw material, which was made by combining clay and flint and this mixture was fired at a far higher heat, with the result that the ingredients vitrified, that is to say, in effect the whole thing became glassy and because of this it was non-porous, and naturally, this was regarded as a great advance.", "Well, that's the situation in the eighteenth century.

There are some subjects you have to do and some that you can choose. The most interesting course I've done is public relations.", "Chloe:", "From what I've read it doesn't look very demanding - some of it is really just common sense.", "Ivan:", "But it will be really useful if you want to go into marketing or advertising.", "Chloe:", "That's true, but I need to find out a bit more about it first before I decide - if it will really help me. It's difficult to tell from the prospectus.", "Ivan:", "But you are interested in marketing?", "Chloe:", "Oh, yes...", "Ivan:", "Well, you can choose a marketing course. I wasn't very impressed with that course actually. The tutor didn't make it very interesting.", "Chloe:", "Mm, it's good to put on your CV that you've done a marketing course, though, so that would be a definite for me and maybe I'd get a different tutor. What other courses did you choose?", "Ivan:", "I'm doing taxation as I was thinking of training to be an accountant but I'm not sure now.", "Chloe:", "Oh, that will be a good option for me because I enjoy working with figures. Although I don't want to be an accountant. It'll be good to have an understanding of taxation, especially if I ever run my own business,", "Ivan:", "Then there's the most popular course, which is human resources and a lot of people seem to get jobs in that field.", "Chloe:", "My friend works in human resources and she's really good at it, but I don't think I've got the right personality so I'd give that one a miss. I'm more interested in how businesses actually work - the structure.", "Ivan:", "That's a compulsory course -- the structure of business - but you might find information systems helpful.", "Chloe:", "Is that kind of computer programs?", "Ivan:", "Some of it is, but also databases, project management, and other things.", "Chloe:", "Oh, sounds useful, but I'll have to look at some of the other possibilities first. You know, Ivan, this course sounds as though it would suit me. I'm going to apply.", "Ivan:", "Great!

In the mid-fifteenth century, a man called Nicholas Cusa, a German mathematician, designed a hygrometer which told people how much humidity there was in the air.", "To do this, Cusa put some sheep's wool on a set of scales and then monitored the change in the wool's weight according to the air conditions.", "A piece of equipment we all know and use is the thermometer. Changes in temperature couldn't really be measured until the Italian Galileo Galilei invented his thermometer in 1593. It wasn't like a modern-day thermometer because it had water inside it instead of mercury.", "In fact, it wasn't until 1714 that Gabriel Fahrenheit invented the first mercury thermometer.", "In 1643 another Italian called Evangelista Torricelli invented the first barometer which measured atmospheric pressure. This was another big step forward in more accurate weather predicting.", "As time went on, during the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, all these meteorological instruments were improved and developed and people in different countries began to record measurements relating to their local weather.", "However, in those days it was very difficult to send records from one part of the world to another so it wasn't possible for them to share their information until the electric telegraph became more widespread.", "This meant that weather observations could be sent on a regular basis to and from different countries. By the 1860s, therefore, weather forecasts were becoming more common and accurate because they were based on observations taken at the same time over a wide area.", "In 1863, France started publishing weather maps each day. This hadn't been done before, and other nations soon followed.", "So that was the start of national weather forecasting and I'll now tell you how we at the National Weather Centre get the information we need to produce a forecast.", "Even today, one of the most important methods we use is observations which tell us what the weather is doing right now. Observation reports are sent automatically from equipment at a number of weather stations in different parts of the country,", "They are nearly all based at airports although a few are in urban centres. The equipment senses temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed direction.", "Meteorologists also rely really heavily on satellites which send images to our computer screens. What we see on our screens is bright colours.", "Orange represents dry air and bright blue shows moisture levels in the atmosphere. The satellites are located 22,000 miles above the surface of the Earth and it's amazing that despite that distance, it's possible for us to make out an individual cloud and follow it as it moves across the landscape.", "In addition to collecting data from the ground, we need to know what's happening in the upper levels of the atmosphere.", "So a couple of times a day from many sites across the country, we send radiosondes into the air.", "A radiosonde is a box containing a package of equipment and it hangs from a balloon which is filled. with gas. Data is transmitted back to the weather station.", "Finally, radar. This was first used over 150 years ago and still. is. New advances are being made all the time and it is one method for detecting and monitoring the progress of hurricanes, Crucial information is shown by different colours representing speed and direction. Radar is also used by aircraft, of course.", "All this information from different sources is put into computer models which are like massive computer programs.", "Sometimes they all give us the same story and sometimes we have to use our own experience to decide which is showing the most accurate forecast which we then pass on to you.", "So I hope next time you watch the weather forecast, you'll think about how we meteorologists spend our time.

What are the dates?", "Man:", "Well, that trip is in the middle of the month. It starts on the 17th of April and it finishes on the 27th.", "Woman:", "That suits me. I can't leave work before the 10th of April.", "Man:", "Let me see if there are any spaces. Is it just for yourself?", "Woman:", "Myself and my sister - so two of us.", "Man:", "Um, yes. We have spaces.", "Woman:", "Is it a big group?", "Man:", "At the moment there are 12 people booked on this trip and with you two that will be 14. The maximum number is 16 so it's almost fully booked. We can't go over that because it's hard to keep a larger group together.", "Woman:", "l need to check that ['m fit enough for this but the distances look OK. The website says we'll ride approximately 45km a day. Is that right?", "Man:", "That's correct and I've got the exact distances here. It really depends on which part of the trip, Some days are only 35km and some are more. But you'!! never have to cycle more than 50km in one day.", "Woman:", "Oh, OK. I can manage that. And we stay in hotels?", "Man:", "Yes. They all have restaurants and the rooms have en-suite facilities.", "Woman:", "And do they have pools? It's how I relax after a long day.", "Man:", "There is a swimming poof in a few of the hotels but none of them has a gym.", "Woman:", "I don't think we'll need a gym after all that cycling!

Then dinner will be in the hotel every evening and that's included in the price of the holiday.", "Woman:", "And you provide the bicycles of course. What else?", "Man:", "A lock and a bell come with the bike as well as lights, although you shouldn't need to cycle in the dark. There's a small bag, or pannier, on the front of the bike, where you can put the things you want to take with you during the day like water or fruit.", "Man:", "But we won't allow you to cycle unless you bring a helmet.

Today John Munroe is going to tell us about local food and eating out. John.", "John:", "Well, most of us buy our food in supermarkets these days but we're very lucky having a wonderful market here. It was originally on the piece of land in front of the cathedral but at the beginning of the twentieth century it was moved to a site by the river.", "John:", "When the new shopping centre was built in the 1960s, it found a home beneath the multi-storey car park where it still is, but there are plans to move it back to its previous home by the river.", "John:", "The market is now open six days a week. On Tuesday to Saturday you can buy fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and cheese from the area, as well as a whole range of imported produce.", "John:", "But if you come on a Sunday, you'll find a different market where craftspeople sell what they have made -things like bags, cards, clothes.", "John:", "During the week there are a few stalls selling more everyday utensils like saucepans and cleaning products alongside the fruit and vegetables -as well as one new stall selling antique furniture which is proving to be very popular.", "John:", "People often ask what our local dish is. As we're by the sea, they expect it to be some kind of fish recipe. Our fish is good of course but there isn't one particular dish that stands out.", "John:", "What we do have is an apple cake that isn't really made anywhere else. There's a new café in the High Street: Barton's, which bakes them fresh every morning and serves them with delicious home-made ice cream in a choice of flavours.", "John:", "Now, the harbour is obviously the place to buy fresh fish. Every morning there's a stall where local fishermen sell a selection of the day's catch before the rest goes to London or abroad.", "John:", "They've been doing that for as long as anyone can remember of course, but the harbour itself looks very different from a few years ago.", "John:", "Most of the restaurants used to be at the far end, but that part was redeveloped and the restaurant had to relocate to the other end.

The friendly staff offer very attentive service and a really enjoyable evening.", "John:", "The Lobster Pot is on the main road going down to the harbour so it also misses out on the sea vièw, but the food makes up for that.", "John:", "It serves a huge range of fish and seafood as well as vegetarian and meat dishes so there's something for everyone.

It means we don't have to worry about getting permission from a shopowner.", "Mike:", "So do you think we should go to all the locations with you?", "Reza:", "It would be a good idea. We need to talk about the levels of background noise so we know they're all going to be reasonable places to film.", "Mike:", "But the sounds of traffic will make it more natural.", "Helen:", "I think Reza means things like aeroplanes, trains and so on that would mean we have to stop filming.", "Reza:", "Exactly.

Because you could start filming one day and come back in the morning to find one of the roads has been dug up!", "Reza:", "The local council has to be informed about things like that so you can find out from them.", "Mike:", "OK. Then I think we need to work from the script and put together a list of all the scenes and decide which ones we're going to film when.", "Mike:", "We need to prepare the shooting schedule,day by day.", "Reza:", "You're right. Then when you know how long filming is going to last, you can tell everyone when they're needed.", "Helen:", "OK, so as soon as we can, we'll audition, and then when we contact people to offer them parts we can send the exact dates and make really sure they are free.", "Helen:", "Because often the actors are all enthusiastic but then when you try to pin them down about whether they're really free at that time, you find they've got exams or something, or they're off to a festival just before and you have to rush about looking for replacements.", "Mike:", "Then, we need people who can take over the main parts if one of our stars falls ill or something.", "Reza:", "Yes, I agree. So offer the main parts to the people we really want, and then look at other volunteers who were OK.", "Helen:", "Yes. We can select the understudies once the main roles have been confirmed. So, once we've got that sorted and we've held all the rehearsals of the main scenes, we'll be ready to start filming.", "Reza:", "Yes, that sounds good. Anything else?", "Mike:", "Er, well, just housekeeping, really. We don't actually need costumes because actors will wear their own clothes.", "Mike:", "My family has agreed to lend us some pieces of furniture which we need, so we'll go and fetch those the weekend before we start.", "Helen:", "We'll provide food and drink during shooting so I'm going to borrow some cool-boxes.", "Mike:", "And I've got a little van. Most of the locations are within walking distance of the halls of residence anyway. The only one further away is the water-mill.", "Reza:", "Ah, yes, can you tell me about that?", "Mike:", "Urn, OK. Er, hang on a minute, I'll get my notes. There's a plan in them.", "Mike:", "Here's the mill. You see, basically you have a vertical water-wheel which was used to power the grinding stones.", "Reza:", "Mm, it sounds really interesting. Will we film inside?", "Helen:", "Yes. That's where the final scene between the girl and the man takes place. Our plan is to fix one camera outside by the window next to the door to film through the window, and then have another handheld camera inside the mill.", "Helen:", "That means we can get two views of the same scene. We were going to do something using a mirror, but we decided that would be too complicated.", "Mike:", "Yes, by doing it that way, all we'll need is lights on the inside, next to the wall behind the wheel which can shine across to the opposite wall.", "Reza:", "Hmm. Will that give enough light?", "Helen:", "I think so, because the scene is in the evening; it shouldn't be too bright. The actors will be carrying torches too.", "Mike:", "And we'll have an old screen made of wood just inside the door, because it's a new door and it'll look wrong.

I want this afternoon as an introduction to our ecology module to offer examples of exotic pests -non-native animals or plants which are, or may be, causing problems -which might prove a fruitful topic for seminar papers later in the term.", "People and products are criss-crossing the world as never before, and on these new global highways, plants and animals are travelling too.", "Exotic plants and animals are turning up in Antarctica and on the most remote islands on Earth.", "For example, the Australian red-backed spider -it's made its way to countries fairly near home, such as New Zealand and Japan, as some of you may know -well, it's also been found on Tristan da Cunha, which is a remote island thousands of miles from anywhere, way out in the middle of the Atlantic.", "Now, another famous animal invader in the other direction, so to speak, from England to Australia in the southern hemisphere, is the rabbit.", "This was in 1830 and it might seem less of a threat, but it became an extraordinarily destructive pest.", "The fact that rabbits increased so rapidly is perhaps more understandable when we remind ourselves that they had originally been introduced to England from continental Europe eight centuries earlier.", "This was because they were regarded as a luxury food source, and in spite of having warm fur, they probably originated on the hot dry plains of Spain, which of course explains why they thrive in the climate of Australia.", "A much less cuddly example of a pest introduced to Australia, this time from America, is fire ants. These are increasing and spreading very fast.", "Their huge nests can now be found in gardens in the city of Brisbane and they are costing the Australian government a great deal of money in control measures.", "These were an accidental introduction, rather than a deliberate one, brought to Australia, probably in horticultural imports or in mud on second-hand machinery.", "As a biologist and conservationist, I have become increasingly concerned about these matters. Exotic invasions are irreversible and deserve to be taken more seriously even when they aren't particularly damaging.", "For example, something that is not necessarily a major disaster compared to other ecological experiments: in 1975 an Australian species of earthworms was deliberately introduced to the northern hemisphere, in Scotland, because they were bigger than the natives.", "The aim was that they would be more effective than native species, but in fact they don't do more for the soil condition than the smaller locals which they displace. Although they don't do a lot of harm, as far as we know up to now, this will probably prove to have been a mistake.", "A much more serious case, also in Scotland, as well as other countries, along with the latest victim, Iceland, is the New Zealand flatworm.", "This is a most unwelcome newcomer in these regions of north-west Europe. Basically, this flatworm came into these countries by accident.", "It's now been realised that it was actually carried in the plant pots containing exotic ornamental shrubs and so on, and as it eats local earthworms, and doesn't benefit the local ecology in any way, it is a real pest.", "Next, there's a further instance, this time in the water and it's come from Japan. It's a delicious but very fast-spreading seaweed and is one of many exotic species, large and small, in the seas covering the rocks around Australia.", "Unfortunately, it is replacing indigenous seaweeds and permanently altering the ecosystem.", "However, to look at the situation from a business point of view -it is now being harvested and exported, dried, back to Japan, its original home, where it's particularly popular.", "So sometimes we may find accidental benefits from apparently harmful arrivals. Well, you could say that world ecology is now going the same way as popular culture.", "Global music and fashions, food and drinks are taking over from local ones in every land. And in ecosystems, we find vigorous exotic invaders overwhelming native species and natural habitats.", "But can we find any examples of invaders which appear to be a problem and then find that in fact they may not be such a big issue after all?", "We might take as an example a native of Australia, the budgerigar, the most common pet parrot in the world, of course. Because there have been many escapes over the years, it is now to be found flying about in feral flocks where the climate suits it.", "So, these flocks of budgerigars have been getting very numerous in the south-east of the United States, particularly in residential areas. People have been getting quite worried about this, but it has been observed that the size of the flocks has diminished somewhat recently.", "The fact that they are smaller is thought to be due to the fact that new competitors for their habitat have arrived from other places.", "That's the last example for now.

He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes – that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and (", ")", ".

But why do staff leave frequently in many hotels? Of course, many hotel jobs, such as cleaning, are low-skilled and are not well-paid.

Well,having to recruit newQ12 staff all the time can be very time-consuming, and managers may have to cover some duties while waiting for new staff to arrive. This means they don’t have time to think about less immediate problems such as how to improve their service. When staff leave, it can also severely affect the colleagues they leave behind. It has a negative effect on remaining staff, who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving.", "So, what can be done to change this situation? Firstly, managers should stop making basic errors which leave their staff feeling upset and resentful. When organising shifts, for example, make sure you never give certain staff preferential treatment. All staff should be givenQ13 some choice about when they work, and everyone should have to work some evening and weekend shifts. If you treat staff fairly, they’ll be more likely to step in and help when extra staff are needed.", "Keeping staff happy has other tangible benefits for the business.

Today we're going to look at another natural food product and that’s maple syrup. What is this exactly? Well, maple syrup looks rather like clear honey, but it’s not made by bees; it’s produced from the plant fluid - or sap - inside the maple tree and that makes maple syrup a very natural product.Maple syrup is a thick, golden, sweet-tasting liquid that Q31 can be bought in bottles or jars and poured onto food such as waffles and ice cream or used in the baking of cakes and pastries. It contains no preservatives or added ingredients, and jt_Q32 provides a healthy alternative to refined sugar.", "Let's just talk a bit about the maple tree itself, which is where maple syrup comes from. So, there are many species of maple tree, and they’ll grow without fertilizer in areas where there’s plenty of moisture in the soil. However, they’ll only do this if another important criterion is fulfilled, which is that they must have full or partial sun exposure during the day and very cool nights - and I’ll talk more about that in a minute. There are only certain parts of the world that provide all these conditions: one is Canada, and by that, I mean all parts of Canada, and the other is the north-eastern states of North America.In these areas, the climate suits the treesQ33 perfectly. In fact, Canada produces over two-thirds of the world's maple syrup, which is why the five-pointed maple leaf is a Canadian symbol and has featured on the flag since 1964.", "So how did maple syrup production begin? Well, long before Europeans settled in these parts of the world, the indigenous communities had started producing maple sugar. They bored holes in the trunks of maple trees and used containers made of tree bark to collect the liquid sap as it poured out. As they were unable to keep the liquid for any length of time - they didn't have storage facilities in those days - they boiled the liquid byplacing pieces of rockQ34 that had become scorching hot from the sun into the sap. They did this until it turned into sugar, and they were then able to use this to sweeten their food and drinks. Since that time, improvements have been made to the process, but it has changed very little overall.", "So let's look at the production of maple syrup today. Clearly, the maple forests are a valuable resource in many Canadian and North American communities. The trees have to be well looked after andthey cannot be used to make svrup until the trunks reach a diameter ofQ35 around 25 centimetres. This can take anything up to 40 years. As I've already mentioned, maple trees need the right conditions to grow and also to produce sap. Why is this? Well, what happens is that during a cold night, the tree absorbs water from the soil, and that rises through the tree’s vascular system. But then in the warmer daytime, the change in temperature causes the water to be pushed back down to the bottom of the tree. This continual movement - up and down - leads to the formation of the sap needed for maple syrup production.", "When the tree is ready, it can be tappedand this involves drilling a small hole into the trunkQ36 and inserting a tube into it that ends in a bucket. The trees can often take several taps, though the workers take care not to cause any damage to the healthy growth of the tree itself. The sap that comes out of the trees consists of 98 percent water and 2 percent sugar and other nutrients. It has to be boiled so that much of that water evaporates, and this process has to take place immediately, using what are called evaporators.These are basicallyQ37 extremely large pans - the sap is poured into these, a fire is built and the pans are then heated until the sap boils. As it does this, the water evaporates, and the syrup begins to form.", "The evaporation process creates large quantities of steam, and the sap becomes thicker and Q38 denser, and, at just the right moment, when the sap is thick enough to be called maple syrup, the worker removes it from the heat. After this process, something called‘sugar sand’ has toQ39 be filtered out as this builds up during the boiling and gives the syrup a cloudy appearance and a slightly gritty taste. Once this has been done, the syrup is ready to be packaged so that it can be used for a whole variety of products.It takes 40 litres of sap to produce one litre ofQ40 maple syrupso you can get an idea of how much is needed!

My name's Mrs Carter and I run the before and after school extended hours childcare service. I hope you’ve had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils. I know that many of you are interested in using our childcare service when your child joins the school, and perhaps you already know something about it, but for those that don’t, I'll go through the main details now.", "We offer childcare for children from the ages of four to eleven both before and after school. I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable. You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for.", "We are insured to provide care for up to 70 children, although we rarely have this many Q11/12 attending at any one session.I think we generally expect around 50-60 children for theQ11/12 afternoon sessions and about half that number for the breakfast sessions. Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us, not all of these attend every day. It’s ten years since we began offering an extended hours service and we’ve come a long way during that time. When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly. We try to keep our costs as low as we can and we think we provide very good value for money.For the afternoon sessions, which run from 3.30 until 6 p.m., it's £7.20. But if you Q13 prefer, you can pay for one hour only, which costs £3.50, or two hours which costs £5.70.", "The cost of the childcare includes food and snacks. They'll be given breakfast in the morning and in the afternoon, a healthy snack as soon as they finish school.At 5 p.m. children areQ14 given something more substantial, such as pasta or a casserole. Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have and we'll make sure they’re offered a suitable alternative.", "As you may know, the childcare service runs through the school holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained - we don’t want them to feel as if they are still at school! It will also feel different because they’ll get the chance to make new friends withchildren from other schools - spaces are availableQ15 for thembecause a lot of our term-time children don’t always attend during the holiday. In the past, parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters - but I’m afraid we’re unable to do this because of the type of insurance we have.", "So now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after-school sessions. As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library, there is usually at least one ‘special’ activity that children can do each day. For example, Spanish. We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs. She does two sessions: one for the over 8s and one for the younger children.This is the only activity which we have to make anQ16 extra charge for- but it's well worth it.", "Once a week the children have the opportunity to do some music. We’re very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band. On Mondays, she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children.We do rely on parental support for this, so if any of you sing or play an Q17 instrument and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we’d be delighted.", "Painting continues to be one of the most popular activities. To begin with we weren’t keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved, butchildren kept asking if they could doQ18 some artand so we finally gave in. Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day.", "Yoga is something that we’ve been meaning to introduce for some time but haven’t been ableQ19 to find anyone available to teach it - until now that is. So we’ll see how this goes. Hopefully, children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this.", "Cooking is another popular activity. They make a different sort of cake, or pizza or bread each week. Although the younger children love doing it, we found that the mess was just too much, sowe’ve decided to restrict this to the over 8s, as they are better able to clean up after Q20 themselves."], "question_groups": [{"context": ["ChooseTWOletters,A-E.", "WhichTWOfacts are given about the school’s extended hours childcare service?"], "context_table": [], "type": "normal", "questions": [{"question_number": "11", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}, {"question_number": "12", "question_text": "", "answer_options": "null", "answer": ""}]}, {"context": ["Choose the correct letter,A, BorC."], "context_table": [], "type": "choice", "questions": [{"question_number": "13", "question_text": "How much does childcare cost for a complete afternoon session per child?", "answer_options": ["A. £3.50", "B. £5.70", "C. £7.20"], "answer": ""}, {"question_number": "14", "question_text": "What does the manager say about food?", "answer_options": ["A.

Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances, such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers. Others, like the Arctic Tern, travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles.", "Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations.", "But until relatively recently, where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery. The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognize as error-filled and even somewhat amusing. Take hibernation theory for example - two thousand years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area, they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans.Another theory for the regular appearanceQ31 and disappearance of birds was that they spent winter hidden in mudtill the weather changed and food became abundant again. The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct.", "One of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year. He developed the theory of transmutation, the seasonal change of one species into another, by observing redstarts and robins.He observed that in the autumn,Q32 small birds called ‘redstarts’ began to lose their feathers, which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter, and back into redstarts in the summer. These assumptions are understandable given thatthis pair of species are similar in shape, but are a classic Q33 example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations.", "The most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist, Charles Morton, in the seventeenth century.He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper claiming that birdsQ34 migrate to the moon and back every year. He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species.", "One of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822 when a white stork was shot in Germany.This particular stork made history because of the long spear inQ35 its neckwhich incredibly had not killed it - everyone immediately realised this spear was definitely not European. It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa. This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology becauseit was the first evidence thatQ36 storks spend their winters in sub-Saharan Africa. You can still see the 'arrow stork’ in the Zoological Collection of the University of Rostock in Germany.", "People gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer but didn’t know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established.Before this, very little information was available about theQ37 actual destinations of particular speciesand how they travelled there. People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds by carrying them on their backs.", "This idea came about becauseit seemed impossible that small birds weighing only a fewQ38 grams could fly over vast oceans. This idea was supported by observations of bird behaviour such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds.", "The development of bird ringing, by a Danish schoolteacher. Hans Christian CorneliusQ39 Mortensen, made many discoveries possible. This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as 'recovery'- this is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to, and identified. Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the twentieth century andfor the first time in history people understood where birds actually wentQ40 to in winter. In 1931, an atlas was published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to.

The original house was replaced in the late seventeenth century, and of course it has had a large number of owners.Almost all of them have left their mark, generallyQ11by adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory, or by demolishing others. The farm looks much as it’s always done, although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds.", "In the seventeenth century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes. His intention was to escape from the world of politics, after years as an active politician, and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings and sculptures. He broke off contact with his former political allies, andhosted meetings ofQ12 creative and literary people, like painters and poets. Unusually for his time, he didn’t care whether his guests were rich or poor, as long as they had talent.", "Big houses like Oniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s, and we’ve tried to show what their working lives were like. Photographs of course don't give much of an idea, so instead, as you go round the house, you’ll seevolunteers dressed up as nineteenth-centuryQ13 servants, going about their work. They’ll explain what they're doing, and tell you their recipes, or what tools they’re using. We’ve just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available.", "I see there are a number of children here with you today. Well, we have several activities specially for children, like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past, and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.OurQ14 latest addition is child-sized tractors, that you can drive around the grounds.", "We’ll also be going into the farm that’s part of the estate, where there’s plenty to do. Most of the buildings date from the eighteenth century, so you can really step back into an agricultural past.", "Until recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese.It’s now theQ15 place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea, or just a cup of coffee and a slice of homemade cake.", "The big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn, and inhere is our collectionQ16 of agricultural tools. These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.", "There's a small barn, also made of stone,where you can groom the donkeys and horses, toQ17 keep their coats clean. They really seem to enjoy having it done, and children love grooming them.", "The horses no longer live in the stables, which instead isthe place to go to buy gifts, books.Q18 our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blanketsmade of wool from our sheep.", "Outside the shed, which is the only brick building,you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage forQ19 a lovely, relaxing tourof the park and farm. The carriages are well over a hundred years old. And finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the eighteenth century, with a lake and trees that are now well established.You’ll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever foundQ20 on farms these days.

Over the past few sessions, we’ve been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline, and today I’m going to introduce another factor that affects languages, and the speakers of those languages, and that’s technology and, in particular, digital technology. In order to illustrate its effect, I'm going to focus on the Icelandic language, whichis spoken by around 321,000 people, most of whom live in IcelandQ31 - an island in the North Atlantic Ocean.", "The problem for this language is not the number of speakers - even though this number is small. Nor is it about losing words to other languages, such as English. In fact,theQ32 vocabulary of Icelandic is continually increasingbecause when speakers need a new word for something, they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language. All this makes Icelandic quite a special language - it’s changed very little in the past millennium, yet it can handle twenty-first-century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology. Take, for example, the word for web browser... this isvafriin Icelandic, which comes from the verb ‘to wander’. I can’t think of a more appropriate term because that’s exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet. Thenthere’s an Icelandic wordQ33 for podcast - which is too hard to pronounce! And so on.", "Icelandic, then, is alive and growing, but - and it's a big but - young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world and this world is predominantly English.Think aboutQ34 smartphones. They didn’t even exist until comparatively recently, but today young people use them all the timeto read books, watch TV or films, play games, listen to music, and so on. Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects becauseit promotes their bilingual skills, butQ35 the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering and it’s all happening really fast.", "For their parents and grandparents, the change is less concerning because they already have their native-speaker skills in Icelandic. But for young speakers - well, the outcome is a little troubling. For example, teachers have found thatplayground conversations in IcelandicQ36 secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English, while teachers of much younger children have reported situations where their classesfind it easier to say what is in a pictureQ37 using English, rather than Icelandic. The very real and worrying consequence of all this is that theyounggeneration in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue.", "Of course, this is happening to other European languages too, but while internet companies might be willing to offer, say, French options in their systems, it's much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice.The other drawback of Icelandic is the grammar, which isQ38 significantly more complex than in most languages. At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this.", "So, what is the Icelandic government doing about this? Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps and other social media and digital systems, but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle.", "On the positive side, they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government. It has survived for well over a thousand years and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so. However, there’s no doubt that it’s becoming an inevitable second choice in young people’s lives.", "This raises important questions. When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language,will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own identity?

Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey, Ireland, Greece, and India. There are various designs of labyrinth but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area. There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area. Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns, but it’s not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.", "In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning and is often used as a synonym for a maze. A maze is quite different asit is a kind of puzzlewith an intricate Q31 network of paths. Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces. The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it’s not possible to see over them. Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times beforeusing logic to work out the patternand find Q32 your way to the centre and then out again. There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started.The word ‘maze’ is believed to come from a ScandinavianQ33 word for a state of confusion. This is where the word ‘amazing’ comes from.", "Labyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function. Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths, this is not how they were seen in the past. The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey. It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives and helped to give people a sense of direction.Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm andQ34 have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.", "The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone, from Q35 Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa. In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age. The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology.In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiralQ36 was used on coinsaround four thousand years ago. Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses, villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.", "In Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on. These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern. The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear, but they were probably used for fertility rites which may date back thousands of years. Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today, includingthe largestQ37 one at Saffron Walden, England, which used to have a large tree in the middle of it.", "More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival. Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness, and there are those who believe in its emotional andphysical benefits, which include slower breathingand a restored sense ofQ38 balance and perspective. This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas, wellness centres and even prisons in recent years.", "A pamphlet at Colorado Children’s Hospital informs patients that 'walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis'. And apparently, it’s not only patients who benefit.", "Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room. Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks. In some hospitals, patients who can’t walk can havea paper 'finger labyrinth’brought to their bed. The science behind the 039 theory is a little sketchy, but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths.

In fact there’s even a saying in English, ‘as dead as the dodo’, used to refer to something which no longer exists. But for many centuries the dodo was alive and well, although it could only be found in one place, the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was a very large bird, about one metre tall, and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly, but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.", "Then in the year 1507 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island. The sailors were carrying", "back to Europe, and found the island a convenient stopping place where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage, but they didn’t settle on Mauritius. However, in 1683 the Dutch arrived and set up a", "there. These first human inhabitants of the island found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat, although not everyone liked the taste.", "It’s hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like. We do have some written records from sailors, and a few pictures, but we don’t know how reliable these are. The best-known picture is a Dutch painting in which the bird appears to be extremely", ", but this may not be accurate – an Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird.", "Although attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds, no complete specimen survives. In the early 17th century four dried parts of a bird were known to exist – of these, three have disappeared, so only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives, a dodo", ". Bones have also found, but there’s only one complete skeleton in existence.", "This single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodos may have been incorrect. For example, early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was, but scientists now believe the bird’s strong knee joints would have made it capable of", "which was not slow, but actually quite fast. In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch.

Another group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo’s skull. They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo were not borne out by their research, which suggested the bird’s", "was not small, but average in size. In fact, in relation to its body size, it was similar to that of the pigeon, which is known to be a highly intelligent bird. The researchers also found that the structure of the bird’s skull suggested that one sense which was particularly well-developed was that of", ". So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit and other food in the island’s thick vegetation.", "————————————–", "So it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed. Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island, they had become extinct. So what was the reason for this? For a long time, it was believed that the dodos were hunted to extinction, but scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this. Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors. These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos, and also monkeys, which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodos’ diet. These were brought to the island deliberately, but the ships also brought another type of creature –", ", which came to land from the ships and rapidly overran the island. These upset the ecology of the island, not just the dodos but other species too. However, they were a particular danger to the dodos because they consumed their eggs, and since each dodo only laid one at a time, this probably had a devastating effect on populations.", "However, we now think that probably the main cause of the birds’ extinction was not the introduction of non-native species, but the introduction of agriculture. This meant that the", "that has once covered all the island, and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo, was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown.

It became a stage musical in the 1980s, anda film version was also released in 2012. So, some of us. I’m sure, have a pretty general idea of the plot. but we know muchless Q37 about the author. Today, I’m going to provide a little more insight into this talented man and I'm going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guernsey in the British Channel Islands.", "But first, his early career ... as I’ve said, he was a writer, he was at the height of his career in Paris and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues. As far as literature was concerned, he was the leading figure of the Romantic movement. However, as well as being a literary genius, he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of poverty in his society. He felt very strongly about this and about other areas where change was needed, like education. This kind of outspoken criticism was not well liked by the rulers of France and, eventually, the emperor — Napoleon III — told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return; in other words, he sent him into exile.", "So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of Europe. Guernsey was actually his third Q33 place of exile and he landed there in 1855. He produced a lot while on Guernsey — including Les Misérables — and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there. This was a property that he bought using the money he’d made in France from the Q34 publication of a collection of his poetry. It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it.", "The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large, five-storey house in the capital town of St Peter Port and he lived there for 15 years, returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon’s Empire collapsed. He decorated and furnished each level, or floor, of the house in unique and wonderful ways, and many people consider the inside of the house to be a ‘work of art’. Today it’s a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year.", "He lived in the house with his family ... and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the Q35 ground floor, along with drawings that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him. In other ground-floor rooms, there are huge tapestries that he would have designed and loved. The walls are covered in dark wood panelling that Victor Hugo created himself using Q36 wooden furniture that he bought in the market. The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings. They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn.", "On the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges, where he entertained his guests. One lounge has entirely red furnishings, such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue. There’s a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wallpaper pattern and the lamps — which he would have made himself by copying original versions.", "His library, where he left many of his favourite books, forms the hallway to the third floor and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons. And then, at the very top of the house, there’s a room called the Lookout — called that because it looks out over the harbour. In contrast to the rather dark lower levels, it’s full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime — often at his desk.", "So, Victor Hugo was a man of many talents, but he was also true to his values. While living in his house on Guernsey, he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large Q39 group of local children from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week. What’s more, he served them their food, which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period.", "In 1927, the house was owned by his relatives, and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris. It has since been restored using photographs from the period and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.", "… So, some of us, I’m sure, have a pretty general idea of the plot, but we know much less about the author.", "general = overall, know much less >< know more, the author", "Đáp án cần điền là một danh từ.

Now, we’ve been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion and to talk about its development over time.", "I decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing and that’s pockets.

Yet, I suspect that, other than that, people don’t really think about pockets too much and they’re rather overlooked as a fashion item.", "It's certainly very interesting to go back in time and see how pockets developed for men and women. In the 18th century, fashions were quite different from the way they are now, and pockets were too. If we think about male fashion first ... that was the time when suits became popular. Trousers were knee-length only and referred to as ‘breeches’, the waistcoats were short and the jackets were long, but all three garments were lined with material and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever tailor the customer used. The wearer could then carry small objects such as pencils or coins on their person and reach them through a gap in the lining. Coat pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish, but they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a profession who needed to carry medical instruments — a doctor or physician, for example.", "The development of women’s pockets was a little different. For one thing, they weren't nearly as visible or as easy to reach as men’s. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women carried numerous possessions on their person and some of these could be worth a lot of money. Women were more vulnerable to theft and wealthy women, in particular, worried constantly about pickpockets. So — what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with string. The pockets were made of fabric, which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money or something more expensive, such as linen, sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery. Women tied the pockets around their waist so that they hung beneath their clothes. Remember, skirts were long then and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn. They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their perfume. Working women, of course, also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in, but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing, they just got bigger or longer — sometimes reaching down to their knees!", "So the tie-on pockets went well into the 19th century and only changed when fashion altered towards the end of that period. That’s when dresses became tighter and less bulky, and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable — they stood out too much and detracted from the woman's image. Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions — and still wanted to — needed somewhere to carry these items about their person. That was when small bags, or pouches as they were known, came into fashion and, of course, they inevitably led on to the handbag of more modern times, particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether.", "I chose pockets for two reasons...\nand even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well, nothing is quite as convenient as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket.
