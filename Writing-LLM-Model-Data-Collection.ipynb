is neither possible nor useful to provide university places for a high proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?###Answer: These days, the government can't provide university places for a high precentage of young people. I a gree of this point, so in this essay, I am going to discuss this veiw and give  an example. In the one hand, that will effect of economic, each country has a plan to improve all  services that young people need, such as education in college and at school. While, it is a hard to provide site for them at university, they should study well at school, and they must to get a high score, that support them to go to high education, as college and university. Also, the most country need private market to enter in university, for example in Oman , if students need to go to Suhar university, they should get a high precentage as 98%. On the other hand, nowadays, students study hard, because they want to study in high education, and the government support them by giving them money, and provide some services for them. For instance, hostel, and bus. Moreover, it is very difficult that the govrnment provide for them place in the college or university, due to teachers and students need more services , as well as they want salaries and a high conidition. In addtion, the economic will decline, if they provide free place for them, they will suffer in the future , they can't get on job.  In conclusion, I believe that if anyone need to study in a high education, they must study well and they will get care and support from the government. Thus, they will achive their goal without feel uncomfortable. ###\n","Name: input, dtype: object"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>input</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>###Question: It is neither possible nor useful to provide university places for a high proportion of young people.
